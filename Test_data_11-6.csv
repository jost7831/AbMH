"A review and synthesis of the measurement invariance literature: Suggestions, practices, and recommendations for organizational research","Vandenberg, Robert J.; Lance, Charles E.","The establishment of measurement invariance across groups is a logical prerequisite to conducting substantive cross-group comparisons (e.g., tests of group mean differences, invariance of structural parameter estimates), but measurement invariance is rarely tested in organizational research. In this article, the authors (a) elaborate the importance of conducting tests of measurement invariance across groups, (b) review recommended practices for conducting tests of measurement invariance, (c) review applications of measurement invariance tests in substantive applications, (d) discuss issues involved in tests of various aspects of measurement invariance, (e) present an empirical example of the analysis of longitudinal measurement invariance, and (f) propose an integrative paradigm for conducting sequences of measurement invariance tests.",2000,,Organizational Research Methods,3,1,Apr-70,,10.1177/109442810031002,,#12128,Vandenberg 2000,,,Yes
The relationships between school climate and adolescent mental health and wellbeing: A systematic literature review,"Aldridge, J.; McChesney, Katrina","Promoting adolescent mental health is a global priority, and schools have an important role to play. This systematic mixed- methods literature review examined relationships between the psychosocial school climate and adolescents’ mental health, mapping the scope and quality of recent research. Forty-eight relevant primary studies published in 2000–2017 were identiﬁed and analysed. These studies highlight associations between the school climate and student mental health, although the lack of experimental and longitudinal studies precludes causal claims. Future research directions include: further investigation of the roles of school safety and the psychosocial academic environment on adolescent mental health; greater consistency in the conceptualisation of both school climate and mental health; and clariﬁcation of the inﬂuence of demographic variables on individual students’ experiences.",2018,,International Journal of Educational Research,88,,121-145,,10.1016/j.ijer.2018.01.012,,#12129,Aldridge 2018,,,No
A systematic literature review of school climate in low and middle income countries,"Larson, Kristine E.; Nguyen, Amanda J.; Orozco Solis, Mercedes Gabriela; Humphreys, Alexandra; Bradshaw, Catherine P.; Lindstrom Johnson, Sarah","Research on school climate has largely been conducted in high-income countries, with less focus on school climate in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). As such, there is limited understanding of how school climate may be associated with students’ socio-emotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes in these contexts. Five reviewers completed a two-stage review process; 35 articles met inclusion criteria for review. Results indicated a lack of consensus in the research around what constitutes or how to measure school climate, but consistent associations with socioemotional, behavioral, and academic outcomes were found. Although ﬁndings suggested that school climate is associated with positive student outcomes in LMICs, additional work is needed to increase the rigor of school climate research and its impact in these settings.",2020,,International Journal of Educational Research,102,,101606,,10.1016/j.ijer.2020.101606,,#12130,Larson 2020,,,No
"Black Youths' perceptions of school cultural pluralism, school climate and the mediating role of racial identity","Smith, Leann V.; Wang, Ming-Te; Hill, Daphne J.","Researchers have become interested in the school climate experiences of Black youth given findings of less positive evaluations of school climate in comparison to their other-race peers. School support for cultural pluralism, also referred to as school support for cultural diversity, has been regarded as one aspect of school climate, but is sometimes distinct from Black youth's ratings of general perceptions of school climate. This project sought to understand the relationship between Black students' perceptions of school support for cultural pluralism and perceptions of school climate. Structural equation modeling techniques were used to determine whether previous perceptions of school support for cultural pluralism predicted later perceptions of school climate in a sample of 336 Black adolescents (Mage = 13.74 years). Furthermore, racial identity was explored as the mechanism through which school support for cultural pluralism impacted school climate appraisals, and differences between Black boys (N = 151) and Black girls (N = 185) were tested. Results confirmed that Black youth who rated their school as being supportive of culturally pluralism had more positive ratings of school climate during the following school year after controlling for the previous year's school climate ratings. However, the mediating role of racial identity differed for Black boys and Black girls, underscoring the need for intersectional research for Black youth and the importance of racial identity. We conclude with a discussion regarding the importance of racial/ethnic identity and pluralism within the school context, as well as, the unique role of school psychologists as preventionists and advocates of change within schools.",2020,,Journal of School Psychology,83,,50-65,,10.1016/j.jsp.2020.09.002,,#12131,Smith 2020,,,Yes

Evaluating Equivalence Testing Methods for Measurement Invariance,"Counsell, Alyssa; Cribbie, Robert A.; Flora, David B.","Measurement Invariance (MI) is often concluded from a nonsignificant chi-square difference test. Researchers have also proposed using change in goodness-of-fit indices (DGOFs) instead. Both of these commonly used methods for testing MI have important limitations. To combat these issues, To combat these issues, it was proposed using an equivalence test (EQ) to replace the chi-square difference test commonly used to test MI. Due to concerns with the EQ’s power, and adjusted version (EQ-A) was created, but provides little evaluation of either procedure. The current study evaluated the Type I error and power of both the EQ and EQ-A, and compared their performance to that of the traditional chi-square difference test and DGOFs. The EQ was the only procedure that maintained empirical error rates below the nominal alpha level. Results also highlight that the EQ requires larger sample sizes than traditional difference-based approaches or using equivalence bounds based on larger than conventional RMSEA values (e.g., > .05) to ensure adequate power rates. We do not recommend the proposed adjustment (EQ-A) over the EQ.",2020,,Multivariate Behavioral Research,55,2,312-328,,10.1080/00273171.2019.1633617,,#12136,Counsell 2020,,,Yes

The Relationship between School Climate Perceptions and School Size and Status,"Çağlayan, Esin1, esin.caglayan@ieu.edu.tr","Over the last three decades, much research into school effectiveness has indicated the importance of school climate in school improvement efforts. This article describes the results of a study on school climate perceptions in relation to school size and status. The study employed a sample of 600 sixth, seventh and eighth grade students and 426 teachers in 16 public and 4 private primary schools in four central districts of Izmir, Turkey. The findings of this descriptive study indicated that both the teachers and the students hold generally positive perceptions about school climate and that there is a significant difference in the school climate perceptions of both the teachers and students in terms of school characteristics. One interesting finding of the present research is that students in public schools have more positive perceptions of school climate than their private school counterparts. In light of the findings of the study, some suggestions were made for school principals as well as policy-makers.

In-School Sustainability Action: Climate Clever Energy Savers,"Buchanan, John1; Schuck, Sandy1; Aubusson, Peter1","The mandate for living sustainably is becoming increasingly urgent. This article reports on the Climate Clever Energy Savers (CCES) Program, a student-centred, problem- and project-based program in New South Wales, Australia, aimed at enabling school students to identify ways of reducing their schools’ electricity consumption and costs. As part of the program, students apply for Department of Education and Communities funds to address issues of electricity usage, such as building or appliance modifications, or education campaigns. In particular, this article focuses on the systemic approach used to assist teachers and students in meeting the aims of the CCES program, the Sustainability Action Process (SAP). To ascertain the contribution and value of such a framework in achieving project outcomes and associated learning and attitudinal change, we investigated teachers’ and some students’ uses and opinions of the SAP via surveys (n = 434), 16 interviews, and analysis of documents such as student work samples and lesson outlines. Our research indicates that the SAP has been a highly effective, enabling and engaging tool in helping students to identify ways and means of reducing electricity consumption and evaluating their effectiveness, as well as identifying allies and other sources of assistance in carrying out their projects.",2016,,Australian Journal of Environmental Education,32,2,154-173,,10.1017/aee.2015.55,,#12142,Buchanan 2016,,,Yes

Engaging discussion about climate change in a Quebec secondary school: A challenge for science teachers,"Barma, Sylvie; Lacasse, Mathieu; Massé-Morneau, Julie","The article analyzes the process of double stimulation in a two-year effort of two science teachers to create and implement a new approach in their teaching. Double stimulation was triggered by three types of conflicts of motives, the first one related to teaching strategies, the second one related to the concept of environment itself, and the third one related to values promoted at the school. The teachers constructed a second stimulus in the form of an open-ended teaching sequence to address the issue of climate change. This artifact enabled the teachers to take agentive actions and implement a novel instructional strategy in their classrooms. As the teaching sequence was progressively implemented and reformulated, pressures from the parents and the school management led to the emergence of new conflicts of motives.",2015,,"Learning, Culture and Social Interaction",4,,28-36,,10.1016/j.lcsi.2014.07.004,,#12144,Barma 2015,,,Yes
"Geography Teachers and Climate Change: Emotions About Consequences, Coping Strategies, and Views on Mitigation","Hermans, Mikaela1, mikaela.hermans@abo.fi","It has been indicated that teachers' emotions about climate change and their views on mitigation influence their instruction and students' engagement in mitigation actions. The aim of the study is to explore Finnish secondary geography teachers' emotions about the consequences of climate change, their strategies for coping with these emotions, and their views on climate change mitigation. Inductive content analysis of data collected through individual interviews (N = 13) was performed. The teachers used emotion-focused, problem-focused, and meaning-focused strategies to cope with negative emotions. They ascribed responsibility for mitigation to politicians and individuals. Commonly, the teachers took elementary actions to reduce their impact on the climate. Only part of the teachers realized that they could contribute through teaching. With the ultimate aim of promoting students' engagement in climate change mitigation, guidelines pertaining to education that targets teachers' emotions, coping strategies, and their views on mitigation are presented.",2016,,International Journal of Environmental & Science Education,11,4,389-408,,10.12973/ijese.2016.326a,,#12145,Hermans 2016,,,Yes

The Relationship of the Creativity of Public and Private School Teachers to their Intrinsic Motivation and the School Climate for Innovation,"Fidan, Tuncer; Oztürk, Inci","The climate for innovation is related with organizational outputs comprising the benefits of ideas, significant innovations and satisfaction of the employees and the service takers; and sophisticated applications of the effectiveness of the services as perceived by service takers. It indicates an organizational willingness necessary for experiencing innovative ideas. As for intrinsic motivation, it can be defined as the experience of one's exposing his/her own talents or abilities. Intrinsically motivated people have the ability of multi faceted reasoning and using various learning strategies. Then intrinsically motivated individuals are expected to be more creative and make innovative efforts to support organizational goals. The goal of this study is to discover the relationship of the creativity levels of the teachers to their intrinsic motivation levels and climates of schools for innovation. The study is designed in correlational research. “Creativity Scale” developed by Zhou & George (2001) and “Climate for Innovation Scale” adapted from Scott & Bruce (1994) and “Intrinsic Motivation Scale” developed by Dündar, Özutku & Taşpınar (2007) were used in the study. The data were collected from teachers working at different levels of public and private schools in Ankara Province during 2014-2015 school year. According to the results of the study private school teachers self-reported to be more intrinsically motivated and creative than public school teachers.

How Climate Change Beliefs among U.S. Teachers Do and Do Not Translate to Students,"Stevenson, Kathryn T.; Peterson, M. Nils; Bradshaw, Amy","Research suggests climate change beliefs among science teachers mirror those of the general public, raising questions of whether teachers may be perpetuating polarization of public opinion through their classrooms. We began answering these questions with a survey of middle school science teachers (n = 24) and their students (n = 369) in North Carolina, USA. Similar to previous studies, we found that though nearly all (92.1%) of students had teachers who believe that global warming is happening, few (12%) are in classrooms with teachers who recognize that global warming is anthropogenic. We found that teacher beliefs that global warming is happening and student climate change knowledge were the strongest predictors of student belief that global warming is happening and human caused. Conversely, teacher beliefs about human causes of global warming had no relationship with student beliefs, suggesting that science teachers’ low recognition of the causes of global warming is not necessarily problematic in terms of student outcomes. These findings may be explained by previous research suggesting adolescents interpret scientific information relatively independently of ideological constraints. Though teacher polarization may be problematic in its own right, it appears that as long as climate change information is presented in classrooms, students deduce anthropogenic causes.",2016,,PLoS ONE,11,9,11-Jan,,10.1371/journal.pone.0161462,,#12149,Stevenson 2016,,,No

Association of grade configuration with school climate for 7th and 8th grade students,"Malone, Marisa; Cornell, Dewey; Shukla, Kathan","Educational authorities have questioned whether middle schools provide the best school climate for 7th and 8th grade students, and proposed that other grade configurations such as K–8th grade schools may provide a better learning environment. The purpose of this study was to compare 7th and 8th grade students’ perceptions of 4 key features of school climate (disciplinary structure, student support, student engagement, and prevalence of teasing and bullying) in middle schools versus elementary or high schools. Multilevel multivariate modeling in a statewide sample of 39,036 7th and 8th grade students attending 418 schools revealed that students attending middle schools had a more negative perception of school climate than students in schools with other grade configurations. Seventh grade students placed in middle schools reported lower disciplinary structure and a higher prevalence of teasing and bullying in comparison to those in elementary schools. Eighth grade students in middle schools reported poorer disciplinary structure, lower student engagement, and a higher prevalence of teasing and bullying compared to those in high schools. These findings can guide school psychologists in identifying aspects of school climate that may be troublesome for 7th and 8th grade students in schools with different grade configurations.

Is There a Relationship Between Schools' Climate Ratings and Student Performance Data?,"Smith, Tim1; Shouppe, Gary2","This study uncovered an issue where most state departments of education in the United States do not track nor focus on professional development for school leaders on school climate. Despite this, a few states have made substantial efforts in bringing the importance of school climate into the assessment of schools conversation. Each public school in Georgia now has annual criteria to meet in relation to school climate due to this expanded view of what makes a successful school. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Georgia's School Climate Star Rating, or SCSR, had an effect on Criterion-Referenced Competency Test (CRCT) Reading and Math achievement. In addition, this study aimed to determine the effect of Title I/non-Title I status, SCSRs, and the interaction between the two on Reading and Math achievement.

Maximizing measurement efficiency of behavior rating scales using Item Response Theory: An example with the Social Skills Improvement System — Teacher Rating Scale,"Anthony, Christopher J.; DiPerna, James C.; Lei, Pui-Wa","Measurement efﬁciency is an important consideration when developing behavior rating scales for use in research and practice. Although most published scales have been developed within a Classical Test Theory (CTT) framework, Item Response Theory (IRT) offers several advantages for developing scales that maximize measurement efﬁciency. The current study provides an example of using IRT to maximize rating scale efﬁciency with the Social Skills Improvement System — Teacher Rating Scale (SSIS — TRS), a measure of student social skills frequently used in practice and research. Based on IRT analyses, 27 items from the Social Skills subscales and 14 items from the Problem Behavior subscales of the SSIS — TRS were identiﬁed as maximally efﬁcient. In addition to maintaining similar content coverage to the published version, these sets of maximally efﬁcient items demonstrated similar psychometric properties to the published SSIS — TRS.",2016,,Journal of School Psychology,55,,57-69,,10.1016/j.jsp.2015.12.005,,#12163,Anthony 2016,,,No
Introduction to bifactor polytomous item response theory analysis,"Toland, Michael D.; Sulis, Isabella; Giambona, Francesca; Porcu, Mariano; Campbell, Jonathan M.","A bifactor item response theory model can be used to aid in the interpretation of the dimensionality of a multifaceted questionnaire that assumes continuous latent variables underlying the propensity to respond to items. This model can be used to describe the locations of people on a general continuous latent variable as well as on continuous orthogonal speciﬁc traits that characterize responses to groups of items. The bifactor graded response (bifac-GR) model is presented in contrast to a correlated traits (or multidimensional GR model) and unidimensional GR model. Bifac-GR model speciﬁcation, assumptions, estimation, and interpretation are demonstrated with a reanalysis of data (Campbell, 2008) on the Shared Activities Questionnaire. We also show the importance of marginalizing the slopes for interpretation purposes and we extend the concept to the interpretation of the information function.

Retaining Early Childhood Education Workers: A Review of the Empirical Literature,"Totenhagen, Casey J.1; Hawkins, Stacy Ann2; Casper, Deborah M.1; Bosch, Leslie A.3; Hawkey, Kyle R.4; Borden, Lynne M.4","Low retention in the child care workforce is a persistent challenge that has been associated with negative outcomes for children, staff, and centers. This article reviews the empirical literature, identifying common correlates or predictors of retention for child care workers. Searches were conducted using several databases, and articles that presented quantitative or qualitative data on retention for center-based child care workers in the United States were reviewed in detail. Seven themes emerged as potential predictors of retention: wages and benefits, job satisfaction, organizational characteristics, alternative employment opportunities, demographic characteristics, job characteristics, and education and training. Although some of the findings were mixed, increased retention was generally associated with the following: working in a publicly operated or nonprofit center that meets accreditation or policy standards, being older, maintaining a higher-level position, having more tenure and experience, receiving higher wages, and reporting higher job satisfaction. Based on these studies, child care centers should seek to increase pay, recruit staff with more experience, and aim to improve job satisfaction among staff to help increase retention. In addition, government-funded professional development incentive programs may help child care centers meet the goals of a high-quality, educated, and stable workforce.",2016,,Journal of Research in Childhood Education,30,4,585-599,,10.1080/02568543.2016.1214652,,#12165,Totenhagen 2016,,,Yes

The effect of interpersonal relationships on burnout syndrome in Secondary Education teachers,"Rodríguez-Mantilla, Jesús Miguel; Fernández-Díaz, Maria José","Recent studies show that teachers, especially in Secondary Education present varying levels of burnout syndrome. This problem could be caused by internal factors unique to the subject (psychological characteristics) or external factors (overwork, social climate, etc.). Method: The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of interpersonal relationships on the development of burnout in a sample of 794 secondary education teachers from the Community of Madrid, applying structural equation modeling methodology. Results: it was observed that the teacher-student relationship has a significant effect on each of the three dimensions of the syndrome (exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy), and the teacher-superiors and teacher-coworker relationships show a moderate effect on these dimensions. Conclusions: The results show the importance of taking care of interpersonal relationships in schools to ensure the wellbeing of teachers and, ultimately, the quality of the learning process.

The current study examined high school staff members’ reports of burnout as they relate to staff demographics and perceptions of self-efficacy and connectedness, as well as school-level contextual variables (e.g., suspension rate and urbanicity). Data were collected from 3,225 high school staff (e.g., teachers and paraprofessionals) in 58 high schools (grades 9–12) across Maryland. Multilevel analyses indicated that perceptions of connectedness, safety, and self-efficacy as well as staff demographics were significantly related to experiences of work-related burnout. At the school level, only school-wide suspension rates were significantly related to higher burnout.

Two informants rated child behaviors in the same home environment, and the degree to which parenting stress impacted the similarity of the ratings was assessed. Overall behavior problem ratings did not differ between groups, but there was poor correspondence between the ratings for individual children, stress did not impact markedly on the discrepancies. Parent–teacher discrepancies in behavior ratings cannot be attributed entirely to differences in the assessment–environment, and there was little evidence of widespread impacts of parenting stress on these discrepant ratings.

Data were collected on the Behaviour Assessment System for Children, second edition (BASC-2; n = 22), and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, second edition (VABS-II; n = 28). Adaptive behaviour ratings generally demonstrated high parent–teacher correlations, while challenging behaviour ratings demonstrated relatively low correlations. Only adaptive skills on the BASC-2 showed significant mean parent–teacher differences, with parent ratings suggesting greater impairment.

"Using parent and youth reports from the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition to identify individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis","Thompson, Elizabeth; Kline, Emily; Reeves, Gloria; Pitts, Steven C.; Bussell, Kristin; Schiffman, Jason","Brief self-report screening can help facilitate early identification of individuals at risk for or in early stages of psychosis. Existing screening tools focus on self-reported attenuated positive symptoms to detect potential risk; however, parent reports may also be helpful for assessing symptoms, especially in younger patients. Recent evidence has shown that the “atypicality” scale within the self-report form of the Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) may be useful for identifying high-risk youth within a more clinically comprehensive and potentially minimally stigmatizing format. The BASC-2 parent report form also includes the atypicality scale, but no research has investigated the relation of this scale to psychosis risk. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the association of parent along with youth reports of BASC-2 atypicality with attenuated positive symptoms as assessed by the Structured Interview for Psychosis-Risk Syndromes (SIPS), in a sample of help-seeking adolescents (n = 63). Results indicate that both parent and youth reports of atypicality predict clinician-rated symptoms. Moreover, the combination of parent and youth report significantly improved prediction of SIPS scores over either single-informant scale. These findings suggest that parent report scales, as ascertained through part of a larger, commonly used measure, may help identify youth at risk for psychosis, particularly if used in conjunction with youth self-report.",2014,,Schizophrenia Research,154,1–3,107-112,,10.1016/j.schres.2014.02.009,,#12187,Thompson 2014,,,Yes

Bayesian structural equation modeling: A more flexible representation of substantive theory,"Muthén, Bengt; Asparouhov, Tihomir","This article proposes a new approach to factor analysis and structural equation modeling using Bayesian analysis. The new approach replaces parameter specifications of exact zeros with approximate zeros based on informative, small-variance priors. It is argued that this produces an analysis that better reflects substantive theories. The proposed Bayesian approach is particularly beneficial in applications where parameters are added to a conventional model such that a nonidentified model is obtained if maximum-likelihood estimation is applied. This approach is useful for measurement aspects of latent variable modeling, such as with confirmatory factor analysis, and the measurement part of structural equation modeling. Two application areas are studied, cross-loadings and residual correlations in confirmatory factor analysis. An example using a full structural equation model is also presented, showing an efficient way to find model misspecification. The approach encompasses 3 elements: model testing using posterior predictive checking, model estimation, and model modification. Monte Carlo simulations and real data are analyzed using Mplus. The real-data analyses use data from Holzinger and Swineford's (1939) classic mental abilities study, Big Five personality factor data from a British survey, and science achievement data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study of 1988.

Multilevel multitrait–multimethod latent analysis of structurally different and interchangeable raters of school climate,"Konold, Timothy; Cornell, Dewey","Informant-based systems of assessment are common platforms for measuring a variety of educational and psychological constructs where the use of multiple informants is considered best practice. In many instances, structurally different informant types (e.g., students and teachers) are solicited on the basis of their unique roles with the target of measurement. The use of multiple informants provides an opportunity to evaluate the degree to which the obtained ratings are influenced by the trait of focus and extraneous sources that can be attributed to the rater. Data from a multilevel multitrait–multimethod design in which students (N = 35,565) and teachers (N = 9,112), from 340 middle schools, responded to items measuring 3 dimensions of school climate were evaluated through a multilevel correlated trait–correlated method latent variable model. Results indicated that ratings of school climate obtained by students and teachers demonstrated high levels of convergent validity, and that school-level ratings obtained by students and teachers were equitable in the assessment of teasing and bullying. Student ratings of support and structure yielded somewhat stronger evidence of convergent validity than ratings obtained by teachers as revealed by their respective trait factor loadings. This was explained in part by the higher levels of common method effects that were observed for teachers. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

The link between parents' perceptions of the school and their responses to school bullying: Variation by child characteristics and the forms of victimization,"Waasdorp, Tracy Evian; Bradshaw, Catherine P.; Duong, Jeffrey","A growing number of researchers encourage parents to notify the school when their children are bullied and work collaboratively with the school to resolve the situation. However, there is limited research on factors that are associated with parents' responses to their child's victimization. Using data from an online survey of 773 parents of victimized students enrolled in 93 schools (elementary, middle, and high), the current study employed structural equation modeling to examine the association between parents' perceptions of the school's climate and parents' responses to their child's victimization. The results indicated that the more favorable parents' perceptions of the climate were, the less likely they were to contact their child's school or talk to their child in response to the victimization. The parents' perception of the climate and response choice also varied as a function of the child's age and the form of bullying experienced. These findings suggest that parents' perceptions of the school are associated with their responses to their child's victimization. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

"Teacher and staff perceptions of school environment as predictors of student aggression, victimization, and willingness to intervene in bullying situations","Espelage, Dorothy L.; Polanin, Joshua R.; Low, Sabina K.","This study examines how teacher and staff perceptions of the school environment correlate with student self-reports of bullying, aggression, victimization, and willingness to intervene in bullying incidents using multi-informant, multilevel modeling. Data were derived from 3,616 6th grade students across 36 middle schools in the Midwest, who completed survey measures of bullying, aggression, victimization, and willingness to intervene in bullying situations. Teachers and staff (n = 1,447) completed a school environment survey. Bivariate associations between school-level and student self-reports indicated that as teacher and staff perceive aggression as a problem in their school, students reported greater bully perpetration, fighting, peer victimization, and less willingness to intervene. Further, as staff and teacher report greater commitment to prevent bullying and viewed positive teacher and student relationships, there was less bullying, fighting, and peer victimization, and greater willingness to intervene. In a model where all school environment scales were entered together, a school commitment to prevent bullying was associated with less bullying, fighting, and peer victimization. Student-reports of bully perpetration and peer victimization were largely explained by staff and teacher commitment to bully prevention, whereas fighting and willingness to intervene were largely explained by student characteristics (e.g., gender). We conclude that efforts to address bullying and victimization should involve support from the school administration. School psychologists should play an active role in the school climate improvement process, by creating a school climate council consisting of students, parents, and teachers; administering school climate measures; identifying specific school improvement targets from these data, and engaging all stakeholders in the ongoing school improvement plan.

Exploring the School Climate--Student Achievement Connection: Making Sense of Why the First Precedes the Second,"Jones, Albert; Shindler, John","Many educators view school climate and student achievement as separate considerations. For some, the idea of promoting a high quality climate can seem like a luxury in the face of the current high stakes assessment climate in which student achievement gains are the paramount consideration. However, the results of this study suggest that climate and student achievement are related. In fact, the quality of the climate appears to be the single most predictive factor in any school's capacity to promote student achievement. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between student academic achievement and various elements within the domain of school climate, and to examine the nature and potential causality of that relationship. The paper also seeks to derive implications for practice including a possible fundamental conceptual framework for climate quality and function and an operational roadmap for moving from a less functional to more functional climate. The study examined school climate and achievement at 30 urban public schools. The sample of schools was drawn from a large geographical area and reflected schools from diverse ethnic and socio-economic communities. Each school assessment team administered the Alliance for the Study of School Climate (ASSC) School Climate Assessment Instrument (SCAI). The team at each school incorporated a standard protocol and surveyed a minimum number of participants (N = 30+ students, 10+ teachers as well as 10+ staff and parents, with most sample sizes being larger). Focus group data were also collected. California State Academic Performance Index (API) and Similar School Rating (SIM) scores (published by the state), were used to measure student achievement at each school. The results of the study confirmed a strong relationship between the quality of school climate and academic achievement levels. While the direction of the causality between the two variables is not entirely indicated by the data, the substantial relationship between climate and SIM rating suggest that a conclusion can be drawn that, to a good degree, better climates led to achievement, and were not simply a byproduct.",2016,,Educational Leadership and Administration: Teaching and Program Development,27,,35-51,,,,#12197,Jones 2016,,,Yes

Students’ ratings of teacher support and academic and social–emotional well-being,"Tennant, Jaclyn E.; Demaray, Michelle K.; Malecki, Christine K.; Terry, Melissa N.; Clary, Michael; Elzinga, Nathan","Data on students’ perceptions of teacher social support, academic functioning, and social–emotional functioning were collected from a sample of 796 7th and 8th grade middle school students using the Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale (CASSS; Malecki, Demaray, & Elliott, 2000), Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS) and school records, and the Behavior Assessment Scale for Children, Second Edition, Adolescent Version, (BASC-2 SRP-A; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004). The purpose of the current study was to examine possible gender differences in perceptions of the frequency and importance of different types of teacher support and the related academic and social–emotional outcomes. Girls rated Emotional and Appraisal Support as more important than did boys. Teacher Emotional Support was significantly and positively related to grade point average (GPA) for boys and girls. For girls only, Emotional and Informational Support were significantly related to ITBS Reading scores, and Emotional, Informational, and Instrumental Support were significantly related to ITBS Math scores. Regarding social–emotional variables, Emotional Support was significantly and negatively related to School Problems, Internalizing Problems, Inattention/Hyperactivity, and overall Emotional Symptoms and positively related to Personal Adjustment for both boys and girls. Furthermore, Emotional Support from teachers was more strongly related to Inattention/Hyperactivity for girls than boys. These results emphasize the importance of providing teacher social support, especially emotional support, to students in early adolescence and recognizing gender differences in the function of specific types of teacher support.

Measurement equivalence: A non-technical primer on categorical multi-group confirmatory factor analysis in school psychology,"Pendergast, Laura L.; von der Embse, Nathaniel; Kilgus, Stephen P.; Eklund, Katie R.","Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) have become a central component of school psychology research and practice, but EBIs are dependent upon the availability and use of evidence-based assessments (EBAs) with diverse student populations. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) is an analytical tool that can be used to examine the validity and measurement equivalence/invariance of scores across diverse groups. The objective of this article is to provide a conceptual and procedural overview of categorical MG-CFA, as well as an illustrated example based on data from the Social and Academic Behavior Risk Screener (SABRS) – a tool designed for use in school-based interventions. This article serves as a non-technical primer on the topic of MG-CFA with ordinal (rating scale) data and does so through the framework of examining equivalence of measures used for EBIs within multi-tiered models – an understudied topic. To go along with the illustrated example, we have provided supplementary files that include sample data, Mplus input code, and an annotated guide for understanding the input code (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsp.2016.11.002).

Parent involvement and children's externalizing behavior: Exploring longitudinal bidirectional effects across gender,"Ogg, Julia; Anthony, Christopher J.","The current study longitudinally examined potential bidirectional associations between parents' home-based involvement, school-based involvement, and home-school communication and their children's externalizing behavior across child gender. Using the Early Childhood-Longitudinal Study – Kindergarten Cohort of 1998–99, three sets of analyses were conducted examining home involvement (n = 16,555), school involvement (n = 12,011), and home-school communication (n = 16,555). Cross-lagged panel analyses indicated a small effect of school-based involvement in kindergarten on externalizing behavior in the first grade but no other significant effects with no differences in patterns across gender. The utilized methodology also enabled an examination of longitudinal trends in different types of parent involvement across gender, which revealed important developmental differences in average parent involvement. Ultimately, the results of this study did not indicate robust unidirectional or bidirectional effects between parent involvement and student externalizing behavior. These findings are an important step forward in understanding the family variables influencing student behavior at school.",2019,,Journal of School Psychology,73,,21-40,,10.1016/j.jsp.2019.02.002,,#12201,Ogg 2019,,,Yes
"Associations between peer victimization, perceived teacher unfairness, and adolescents' adjustment and well-being","Gini, Gianluca; Marino, Claudia; Pozzoli, Tiziana; Holt, Melissa","Negative relationships within the classroom, both with peers and teachers, can be very stressful for adolescents and are often found to be associated with a variety of negative outcomes. In this study, we investigated the concurrent role of peer victimization and perceived teacher unfairness in explaining psychosocial problems in a sample of 1378 Italian students (353 middle school students, Mage=12.61, SD=0.69, and 1025 high school students, Mage=14.92, SD=0.81). Structural equation modeling showed that both peer victimization and perceived teacher unfairness were positively associated with reports of more frequent psychological and somatic problems, and negatively related to satisfaction with friends and sense of safety. Only perceived teacher unfairness showed a significant association with satisfaction with school. Results of multi-group modeling demonstrated measurement invariance (total scalar invariance) across both gender and school-level groups. Some gender and school-level differences in the regression coefficients were found. In general, associations between the risk factors and adolescents' problems were stronger for girls and for higher school students. Findings confirmed that both peer victimization and perceived teacher unfairness are significant risk factors within the classroom microsystems. Implications for school psychologists are discussed.",2018,,Journal of School Psychology,67,,56-68,,10.1016/j.jsp.2017.09.005,,#12202,Gini 2018,,,Yes
The assessment of school engagement: Examining dimensionality and measurement invariance by gender and race/ethnicity,"Wang, Ming-Te; Willett, John B.; Eccles, Jacquelynne S.","The construct of school engagement has attracted growing interest as a way to ameliorate the decline in academic achievement and increase in dropout rates. The current study tested the ﬁt of a second-order multidimensional factor model of school engagement, using large-scale representative data on 1103 students in middle school. In order to make valid model comparisons by group, we evaluated the extent to which the measurement structure of this model was invariant by gender and by race/ethnicity (European-American vs. African-American students). Finally, we examined differences in latent factor means by these same groups. From our conﬁrmatory factor analyses, we concluded that school engagement was a multidimensional construct, with evidence to support the hypothesized second-order engagement factor structure with behavioral, emotional, and cognitive dimensions. In this sample, boys and girls did not substantially differ, nor did European-American and African-American students, in terms of the underlying constructs of engagement and the composition of these constructs. Finally, there were substantial differences in behavioral and emotional engagement by gender and by racial/ethnic groups in terms of second-order factor mean differences.",2011,,Journal of School Psychology,49,4,465-480,,10.1016/j.jsp.2011.04.001,,#12203,Wang 2011,,,No

Power and sensitivity of alternative fit indices in tests of measurement invariance,"Meade, Adam W.; Johnson, Emily C.; Braddy, Phillip W.","Confirmatory factor analytic tests of measurement invariance (MI) based on the chi-square statistic are known to be highly sensitive to sample size. For this reason, G. W. Cheung and R. B. Rensvold (2002) recommended using alternative fit indices (AFIs) in MI investigations. In this article, the authors investigated the performance of AFIs with simulated data known to not be invariant. The results indicate that AFIs are much less sensitive to sample size and are more sensitive to a lack of invariance than chi-square-based tests of MI. The authors suggest reporting differences in comparative fit index (CFI) and R. P. McDonald's (1989) noncentrality index (NCI) to evaluate whether MI exists. Although a general value of change in CFI (.002) seemed to perform well in the analyses, condition specific change in McDonald's NCI values exhibited better performance than a single change in McDonald's NCI value. Tables of these values are provided as are recommendations for best practices in MI testing.

The link between school climate and violence in school: A meta-analytic review,"Steffgen, Georges; Recchia, Sophie; Viechtbauer, Wolfgang","There has been signiﬁcant interest in whether and how school climate and violent behavior are meaningfully related. The present meta-analysis reviewed studies reporting a relationship between school climate and school violence in order to summarize the total effect and the direction of these research ﬁndings. Database consultation and literature hand searching yielded 145 articles which were reviewed by two experts. Studies were included if they reported a statistical effect size of the relationship between school climate and school violence. Exclusion criteria were unclear operationalization of the principal variables, research ﬁndings from multiple publications, studies using multi-level analysis and qualitative studies. The meta-analysis included 36 independent studies (N = 113,778) with correlations ranging from −.02 to − .53. Using a random-effects model a moderate mean effect size of r = − .26, CI [−30, − 21] was found. Statistical ﬁndings indicated signiﬁcant heterogeneity and a large range of variance between studies. Meta-regressions analyzed different potential moderators as relevant factors of heterogeneity, but none of these factors could be identiﬁed as a moderator. Due to the large variance between the studies, it remains difﬁcult to draw ﬁnal conclusions.

The Impact of School Climate and School Identification on Academic Achievement: Multilevel Modeling with Student and Teacher Data,"Maxwell, Sophie; Reynolds, Katherine J.; Lee, Eunro; Subasic, Emina; Bromhead, David","School climate is a leading factor in explaining student learning and achievement. Less work has explored the impact of both staff and student perceptions of school climate raising interesting questions about whether staff school climate experiences can add “value” to students’ achievement. In the current research, multiple sources were integrated into a multilevel model, including staff self-reports, student self-reports, objective school records of academic achievement, and socio-economic demographics. Achievement was assessed using a national literacy and numeracy tests (N = 760 staff and 2,257 students from 17 secondary schools). In addition, guided by the “social identity approach,” school identiﬁcation is investigated as a possible psychological mechanism to explain the relationship between school climate and achievement. In line with predictions, results show that students’ perceptions of school climate signiﬁcantly explain writing and numeracy achievement and this effect is mediated by students’ psychological identiﬁcation with the school. Furthermore, staff perceptions of school climate explain students’ achievement on numeracy, writing and reading tests (while accounting for students’ responses). However, staff’s school identiﬁcation did not play a signiﬁcant role. Implications of these ﬁndings for organizational, social, and educational research are discussed.",2017,,Front.

Measurement invariance within and between individuals: a distinct problem in testing the equivalence of intra- and inter-individual model structures,"Adolf, Janne; Schuurman, Noémi K.; Borkenau, Peter; Borsboom, Denny; Dolan, Conor V.","We address the question of equivalence between modeling results obtained on intra-individual and inter-individual levels of psychometric analysis. Our focus is on the concept of measurement invariance and the role it may play in this context. We discuss this in general against the background of the latent variable paradigm, complemented by an operational demonstration in terms of a linear state-space model, i.e., a time series model with latent variables. Implemented in a multiple-occasion and multiple-subject setting, the model simultaneously accounts for intra-individual and inter-individual differences. We consider the conditions – in terms of invariance constraints – under which modeling results are generalizable (a) over time within subjects, (b) over subjects within occasions, and (c) over time and subjects simultaneously thus implying an equivalence-relationship between both dimensions. Since we distinguish the measurement model from the structural model governing relations between the latent variables of interest, we decompose the invariance constraints into those that involve structural parameters and those that involve measurement parameters and relate to measurement invariance. Within the resulting taxonomy of models, we show that, under the condition of measurement invariance over time and subjects, there exists a form of structural equivalence between levels of analysis that is distinct from full structural equivalence, i.e., ergodicity. We demonstrate how measurement invariance between and within subjects can be tested in the context of high-frequency repeated measures in personality research. Finally, we discuss problems of measurement variance in relation to problems of non-ergodicity as currently discussed and approached in the literature.",2014,,Front.

Multilevel confirmatory factor analysis of the Effective Behavior Support Self-Assessment Survey,"Rice, Kenneth G.; Srisarajivakul, Emily N.; Meyers, Joel; Varjas, Kris","One evaluation measure available through the Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports framework is the Effective Behavior Support Self-Assessment Survey (SAS). Evaluations of the SAS have supported its factor structure. However, the SAS is designed to be completed by school personnel who are nested within other levels of analysis (e.g., schools, grade level, district). There have been no studies examining the SAS from a multilevel perspective. The current study addressed this gap by evaluating the SAS using data from 1,726 respondents across 36 public schools in 3 school districts. Another purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the SAS can be shortened yet remain psychometrically sound to encourage completion of the survey by busy school staff members. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated substantial dependence in item responses. Factor correlations were substantial across all models tested. Compared with a 2nd-order, hierarchical model and the basic 4-factor model based on the original hypothesized structure of the SAS, the best combination of fit and parsimony was obtained from a reduced set of 24 of the original 46 items organized within a multilevel bifactor structure (e.g., comparative fit index = .979, root-mean-square error of approximation = .019), suggesting that the SAS may be shortened. The bifactor model partitioned item variances to a general implementation fidelity factor and to 1 of the 4 hypothesized factors. These results suggest that the SAS items aim to describe dimensions for measuring implementation status that may be as relevant at the school level as they are at the individual level.

Results from this study support previous research in suggesting teachers would be more attracted to high-need high schools (HNHS) if provided more money. Yet, participants reported caring was the most important reason for them staying in their current high-need schools. Teachers indicated caring, greater exposure to high-need schools in teacher preparation programs, and other non-pecuniary factors were essential characteristics for successful HNHS.

"School climate, peer victimization, and academic achievement: Results from a multi-informant study","Wang, Weijun; Vaillancourt, Tracy; Brittain, Heather L.; McDougall, Patricia; Krygsman, Amanda; Smith, David; Cunningham, Charles E.; Haltigan, J. D.; Hymel, Shelley","School-level school climate was examined in relation to self-reported peer victimization and teacher-rated academic achievement (grade point average; GPA). Participants included a sample of 1,023 fifth-grade children nested within 50 schools. Associations between peer victimization, school climate, and GPA were examined using multilevel modeling, with school climate as a contextual variable. Boys and girls reported no differences in victimization by their peers, although boys had lower GPAs than girls. Peer victimization was related to lower GPA and to a poorer perception of school climate (individual-level), which was also associated with lower GPA. Results of multilevel analyses revealed that peer victimization was again negatively associated with GPA, and that lower school-level climate was associated with lower GPA. Although no moderating effects of school-level school climate or sex were observed, the relation between peer victimization and GPA remained significant after taking into account (a) school-level climate scores, (b) individual variability in school-climate scores, and (c) several covariates—ethnicity, absenteeism, household income, parental education, percentage of minority students, type of school, and bullying perpetration. These findings underscore the importance of a positive school climate for academic success and viewing school climate as a fundamental collective school outcome. Results also speak to the importance of viewing peer victimization as being harmfully linked to students’ academic performance. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

Organizing Schools for Improvement : Lessons From Chicago,"Bryk, A. S.; Sebring, P. B.; Allensworth, E.; Luppescu, S.; Easton, J. Q.","In 1988, the Chicago public school system decentralized, granting parents and communities significant resources and authority to reform their schools in dramatic ways. To track the effects of this bold experiment, the authors of Organizing Schools for Improvement collected a wealth of data on elementary schools in Chicago. Over a seven-year period they identified one hundred elementary schools that had substantially improved—and one hundred that had not. What did the successful schools do to accelerate student learning? The authors of this illuminating book identify a comprehensive set of practices and conditions that were key factors for improvement, including school leadership, the professional capacity of the faculty and staff, and a student-centered learning climate.

The limitations of model fit in comparing the bi-factor versus higher-order models of human cognitive ability structure,"Murray, Aja L.; Johnson, Wendy","We addressed the question of whether the bi-factor or higher-order model is the more appropriate model of human cognitive ability structure. In previously published nested confirmatory factor analyses, the bi-factor model tended to be better fitting than the higher-order model; however, these studies did not consider a possible inherent statistical bias favouring the fit of the bi-factor model. In our own analyses and consistent with previous empirical results, the bi-factor model was also better fitting than the higher-order model. However, simulation results suggested that the comparison of bi-factor and higher-order models is substantially biased in favour of the bi-factor model when, as is commonly the case in CFA analyses, there is unmodelled complexity. These results suggest that decisions as to which model to adopt either as a substantive description of human cognitive ability structure or as a measurement model in empirical analyses should not rely on which is better fitting.",2013,,Intelligence,41,5,407-422,,10.1016/j.intell.2013.06.004,,#12248,Murray 2013,,,Yes
The Bifactor Model Fits Better Than the Higher-Order Model in More Than 90% of Comparisons for Mental Abilities Test Batteries,"Cucina, Jeffrey; Byle, Kevin","The factor structure of mental abilities has most often been depicted using a higher-order model. Under this model, general mental ability (g) is placed at the top of a pyramid, with “loading” arrows going from it to the other factors of intelligence, which in turn go to subtest scores. In contrast, under the bifactor model (also known as the nested factors/direct hierarchical model), each subtest score has its own direct loading on g; the non-g factors (e.g., the broad abilities) do not mediate the relationships of the subtest scores with g. Here we summarized past research that compared the ﬁt of higher-order and bifactor models using conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). We also analyzed additional archival datasets to compare the ﬁt of the two models. Using a total database consisting of 31 test batteries, 58 datasets, and 1,712,509 test takers, we found stronger support for a bifactor model of g than for the traditional higher-order model. Across 166 comparisons, the bifactor model had median increases of 0.076 for the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), 0.083 for the Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and 0.078 for the Normed Fit Index (NFI) and decreases of 0.028 for the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and 1343 for the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Consequently, researchers should consider using bifactor models when conducting CFAs. The bifactor model also makes the unique contributions of g and the broad abilities to subtest scores more salient to test users.",2017,,J.

Evaluating Model Fit With Ordered Categorical Data Within a Measurement Invariance Framework: A Comparison of Estimators,"Sass, Daniel A.; Schmitt, Thomas A.; Marsh, Herbert W.","A paucity of research has compared estimation methods within a measurement invariance (MI) framework and determined if research conclusions using normal-theory maximum likelihood (ML) generalizes to the robust ML (MLR) and weighted least squares means and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimators.

When testing for metric and scalar invariance, χ 2 results revealed that Type I error rates varied across estimators (ML, MLR, and WLSMV) with symmetric and asymmetric data. The χ 2 power varied substantially based on the estimator selected, type of noninvariant indicator, number of noninvariant indicators, and sample size. Although some the changes in approximate ﬁt indexes ( AFI) are relatively sample size independent, researchers who use the AFI with WLSMV should use caution, as these statistics do not perform well with misspeciﬁed models.

When Fit Indices and Residuals Are Incompatible,"Browne, Michael W.; MacCallum, Robert C.; Kim, Cheong-Tag; Andersen, Barbara L.; Glaser, Ronald","Standard chi-square-based fit indices for factor analysis and related models have a little known property: They are more sensitive to misfit when unique variances are small than when they are large. Consequently, very small correlation residuals indicating excellent fit can be accompanied by indications of bad fit by the fit indices when unique variances are small. An empirical example of this incompatibility between residuals and fit indices is provided. For illustrative purposes, an artificial example is provided that yields exactly the same correlation residuals as the empirical example but has larger unique variances. For this example, the fit indices indicate excellent fit.

Comparative fit indexes in structural models,"Bentler, P. M.","Normed and nonnormed fit indexes are frequently used as adjuncts to chi-square statistics for evaluating the fit of a structural model. A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of 2 nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFIN) and nonnormed (FIN) fit indexes. CFIN avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for P. M. Bentler and D. G. Bonett's (see record [rid]1981-06898-001[/rid]) normed fit index (NFIN). FIN is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's nonnormed fit index (NNFIN) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFIN. Asymptotically, CFIN, FIN, NFIN, and a new index developed by K. A. Bollen (1989) are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFIN measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.

Identification of Confirmatory Factor Analysis Models of Different Levels of Invariance for Ordered Categorical Outcomes,"Wu, Hao; Estabrook, Ryne","This article considers the identiﬁcation conditions of conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) models for ordered categorical outcomes with invariance of different types of parameters across groups. The current practice of invariance testing is to ﬁrst identify a model with only conﬁgural invariance and then test the invariance of parameters based on this identiﬁed baseline model. This approach is not optimal because different identiﬁcation conditions on this baseline model identify the scales of latent continuous responses in different ways. Once an invariance condition is imposed on a parameter, these identiﬁcation conditions may become restrictions and deﬁne statistically non-equivalent models, leading to different conclusions. By analyzing the transformation that leaves the model-implied probabilities of response patterns unchanged, we give identiﬁcation conditions for models with invariance of different types of parameters without referring to a speciﬁc parametrization of the baseline model. Tests based on this approach have the advantage that they do not depend on the speciﬁc identiﬁcation condition chosen for the baseline model.",2016,,Psychometrika,81,4,1014-1045,,10.1007/s11336-016-9506-0,,#12267,Wu 2016,,,Yes

Invited Paper: The Rediscovery of Bifactor Measurement Models,"Reise, Steven P.","Bifactor latent structures were introduced over 70 years ago, but only recently has bifactor modeling been rediscovered as an effective approach to modeling construct-relevant multidimensionality in a set of ordered categorical item responses. I begin by describing the Schmid-Leiman bifactor procedure (), and highlight its relations with correlated-factors and second-order exploratory factor models. After describing limitations of the Schmid-Leiman, two newer methods of exploratory bifactor modeling are considered, namely, analytic bifactor () and target bifactor rotations (). In section two, I discuss limited and full-information estimation approaches to confirmatory bifactor models that have emerged from the item response theory and factor analysis traditions, respectively. Comparison of the confirmatory bifactor model to alternative nested confirmatory models and establishing parameter invariance for the general factor also are discussed. In the final section, important applications of bifactor models are reviewed. These applications demonstrate that bifactor modeling potentially provides a solid foundation for conceptualizing psychological constructs, constructing measures, and evaluating a measure’s psychometric properties. However, some applications of the bifactor model may be limited due to its restrictive assumptions.",2012,,Multivariate Behav Res,47,5,667-696,,10.1080/00273171.2012.715555,,#12271,Reise 2012,,,No

A Bifactor Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling Framework for the Identification of Distinct Sources of Construct-Relevant Psychometric Multidimensionality,"Morin, Alexandre J. S.; Arens, A. Katrin; Marsh, Herbert W.","This study illustrates an overarching psychometric approach of broad relevance to investigations of 2 sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality present in many complex multidimensional instruments routinely used in psychological and educational research. These 2 sources of construct-relevant psychometric multidimensionality are related to (a) the fallible nature of indicators as perfect indicators of a single construct, and (b) the hierarchical nature of the constructs being assessed. The first source is identified by comparing confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) solutions. The second source is identified by comparing first-order, hierarchical, and bifactor measurement models. To provide an applied illustration of the substantive relevance of this framework, we first apply these models to a sample of German children (N = 1,957) who completed the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ–I). Then, in a second study using a simulated data set, we provide a more pedagogical illustration of the proposed framework and the broad range of possible applications of bifactor ESEM models.",2016,,Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal,23,1,116-139,,10.1080/10705511.2014.961800,,#12273,Morin 2016,,,No

Understanding the Impact of Partial Factorial Invariance on Selection Accuracy: An R Script,"Lai, Mark H. C.; Kwok, Oi-man; Yoon, Myeongsun; Hsiao, Yu-Yu","Much of the previous literature on partial measurement invariance has focused on (a) statistically detecting noninvariance, and (b) modeling partial invariance to obtain correct inferences for latent mean comparisons across groups in a single research study. However, very little guidance is provided on the practical implications of partial invariance on the instrument itself in the context of selection. In a frequently cited paper, Millsap and Kwok (2004) provided a framework for evaluating the impact of partial invariance by quantifying the magnitude of noninvariance on the efﬁcacy of the test for selection purposes, yet our literature review found that only a few of the citations have fully captured the essence of Millsap and Kwok’s method. In this article, we brieﬂy review the selection accuracy analysis for partial invariance and provide a user-friendly R script (also available as a Web application) that takes parameter estimates as input, automatically produces summary statistics for evaluating selection accuracy, and generates a graph for visualizing the results. Hypothetical and real data examples are provided to illustrate the use of the R script.

The Impact of Partial Measurement Invariance on Testing Moderation for Single and Multi-Level Data,"Hsiao, Yu-Yu; Lai, Mark H. C.","Moderation effect is a commonly used concept in the ﬁeld of social and behavioral science. Several studies regarding the implication of moderation effects have been done; however, little is known about how partial measurement invariance inﬂuences the properties of tests for moderation effects when categorical moderators were used. Additionally, whether the impact is the same across single and multilevel data is still unknown. Hence, the purpose of the present study is twofold: (a) To investigate the performance of the moderation test in single-level studies when measurement invariance does not hold; (b) To examine whether unique features of multilevel data, such as intraclass correlation (ICC) and number of clusters, inﬂuence the effect of measurement non-invariance on the performance of tests for moderation. Simulation results indicated that falsely assuming measurement invariance lead to biased estimates, inﬂated Type I error rates, and more gain or more loss in power (depends on simulation conditions) for the test of moderation effects. Such patterns were more salient as sample size and the number of non-invariant items increase for both single- and multi-level data. With multilevel data, the cluster size seemed to have a larger impact than the number of clusters when falsely assuming measurement invariance in the moderation estimation. ICC was trivially related to the moderation estimates. Overall, when testing moderation effects with categorical moderators, employing a model that accounts for the measurement (non)invariance structure of the predictor and/or the outcome is recommended.",2018,,Front.

Data were generated from 2 models with 2-7 categories, 4 sample sizes, 2 latent distributions, and 5 patterns of category thresholds. Results revealed that factor loadings and robust standard errors were generally most accurately estimated using cat-LS, especially with fewer than 5 categories; however, factor correlations and model fit were assessed equally well with ML. Cat-LS was found to be more sensitive to sample size and to violations of the assumption of normality of the underlying continuous variables. Normal theory ML was found to be more sensitive to asymmetric category thresholds and was especially biased when estimating large factor loadings. Accordingly, we recommend cat-LS for data sets containing variables with fewer than 5 categories and ML when there are 5 or more categories, sample size is small, and category thresholds are approximately symmetric. With 6-7 categories, results were similar across methods for many conditions; in these cases, either method is acceptable.;",2012,,Psychological Methods,17,3,354-373,22799625,10.1037/a0029315,,#12279,Rhemtulla 2012,,,Yes
Improving measurement-invariance assessments: correcting entrenched testing deficiencies,"Hayduk, Leslie A.","BackgroundFactor analysis historically focused on measurement while path analysis employed observed variables as though they were error-free. When factor- and path-analysis merged as structural equation modeling, factor analytic notions dominated measurement discussions – including assessments of measurement invariance across groups. The factor analytic tradition fostered disregard of model testing and consequently entrenched this deficiency in measurement invariance assessments.DiscussionApplying contemporary model testing requirements to the so-called configural model initiating invariance assessments will improve future assessments but a substantial backlog of deficient assessments remain to be overcome., This articlesummarizes the issues,demonstrates the problem using a recent example,illustrates a superior model assessment strategy,and documents disciplinary entrenchment of inadequate testing as exemplified by the journal Organizational Research Methods.SummaryEmploying the few methodologically and theoretically best, rather than precariously-multiple, indicators of latent variables increases the likelihood of achieving properly causally specified structural equation models capable of displaying measurement invariance. Just as evidence of invalidity trumps reliability, evidence of configural model misspecification trumps invariant estimates of misspecified coefficients.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12874-016-0230-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",2016,,BMC Med Res Methodol,16,,,,10.1186/s12874-016-0230-3,,#12280,Hayduk 2016,,,No
Testing Measurement Invariance for a Second-Order Factor. A Cross-National Test of the Alienation Scale,"Rudnev, Maksim; Lytkina, Ekaterina; Davidov, Eldad; Schmidt, Peter; Zick, Andres","Multiple group confirmatory factor analysis has become the most common technique for assessing measurement invariance. However, higher-order factor modeling is less frequently discussed in this context. In particular, the literature provides only very general guidelines for testing measurement invariance of second-order factor models, which is a prerequisite for conducting meaningful comparative research using higher-order factors. The current paper attempts to fill this gap. First, we explicate the constraints required for identification of the invariance levels in a multiple group second-order factor model. Second, in addition to the conventional interpretation of the results of this assessment, we suggest an alternative view on the invariance properties of a second-order factor as evidence of structural rather than measurement invariance. Third, we present an empirical application of the test which builds on Seeman’s alienation scale and utilizes data from eight countries collected in 2008-2009. We found empirical support for metric invariance of both the firstand second-order factors, but no support for scalar invariance of the first- and second-order factors. However, we find pairs of countries where scalar invariance for both the first- and second-order factors is supported by the data.

These findings provide some empirical support for the use of the teacher version of the ASCS in high schools.",2016,,Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment,34,6,536-549,,10.1177/0734282915621439,,#12284,Huang 2016,,,No
A Psychometric Evaluation of a Revised School Climate Teacher Survey,"Liu, Ying; Ding, Cody; Berkowitz, Marvin W.; Bier, Melinda C.","The concept of school climate has been an important topic for education and it has been studied extensively over the past several decades. One of the challenges in such a research effort is to develop instruments that effectively and efficiently measure the construct. Literature has documented a number of school climate instruments, most of which target students’ perceptions. A review of recent literature on school climate suggests that it is imperative to assess teachers’ perceptions of school climate. The purpose of this study was to examine the factor structure and reliability of a revised version of a teacher survey instrument designed to measure school climate. Based on the data from a comprehensive character education project implemented in an urban school district in 2007 (n = 380), 2008 (n = 305), and 2010 (n = 277), results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis revealed a seven-factor structure across 3 years, indicating a stable factor structure of the revised form. The scales in this abbreviated form demonstrated similar reliability to those of the original form.",2014,,Canadian Journal of School Psychology,29,1,54-67,,10.1177/0829573514521777,,#12285,Liu 2014,,,Yes

Measuring Adolescents’ Affective Civic Competence: Validity and Cross-Group Equivalence of a Second-Order Hierarchical Latent Construct,"Gerosa, Tiziano","In the last few decades, educational literature and policy makers have increasingly supported research into affective competencies—attitudes, emotions, values/ethics and motivation—as a key requirement to fostering positive youth development in the area of active and engaged citizenship. Considering that adolescents have limited opportunities to undertake civic and political activities until the age of majority, robust indicators of their affective competencies could represent valid alternatives for the analysis of their educational needs and the prediction of their future engagement. Nonetheless, researchers interested in comparing these self-perceived measures across individuals and groups must pay particularly attention to the assumption of their strong factorial invariance, which could lead to inaccurate inferences if violated. On these grounds, the present study validates and assesses the cross-group equivalence of the affective civic competence (ACC) latent construct on a sample of 3366 Italian 8th grade students, exploring also the individual differences emerging in its latent mean structure. The factorial validity of the construct and its measurement invariance across students’ gender and ethnicity are proved through the statistical techniques of second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multi-group mean and covariance structure analysis (MG-MACS). Results of the cross-group comparisons show that students’ gender does not lead to significant differences in their overall ACC mean score after correcting for partial scalar invariance, while members of ethnic minorities prove to be disadvantaged compared to natives. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research are discussed.",2019,,Applied Research in Quality of Life,14,2,335-358,,10.1007/s11482-018-9595-2,,#12288,Gerosa 2019,,,Yes
"School Climate: a Review of the Construct, Measurement, and Impact on Student Outcomes","Wang, Ming-Te; Degol, Jessica L.","The construct of school climate has received attention as a way to enhance student achievement and reduce problem behaviors. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the existing literature on school climate and to bring to light the strengths, weakness, and gaps in the ways researchers have approached the construct. The central information in this article is organized into five sections. In the first, we describe the theoretical frameworks to support the multidimensionality of school climate and how school climate impacts student outcomes. In the second, we provide a breakdown of the four domains that make up school climate, including academic, community, safety, and institutional environment. In the third, we examine research on the outcomes of school climate. In the fourth, we outline the measurement and analytic methods of the construct of school climate.

The moderating effects of school climate on bullying prevention efforts.,"Low, Sabina; Van Ryzin, Mark","Bullying prevention efforts have yielded mixed effects over the last 20 years. Program effectiveness is driven by a number of factors (e.g., program elements and implementation), but there remains a dearth of understanding regarding the role of school climate on the impact of bullying prevention programs. This gap is surprising, given research suggesting that bullying problems and climate are strongly related. The current study examines the moderating role of school climate on the impacts of a stand-alone bullying prevention curriculum. In addition, the current study examined 2 different dimensions of school climate across both student and staff perceptions. Data for this study were derived from a Steps to Respect (STR) randomized efﬁcacy trial that was conducted in 33 elementary schools over a 1-year period. Schools were randomly assigned to intervention or wait-listed control condition. Outcome measures (pre-topost) were obtained from (a) all school staff, (b) a randomly selected subset of 3rd–5th grade teachers in each school, and (c) all students in classrooms of selected teachers. Multilevel analyses revealed that psychosocial climate was strongly related to reductions in bullying-related attitudes and behaviors. Intervention status yielded only 1 signiﬁcant main effect, although, STR schools with positive psychosocial climate at baseline had less victimization at posttest. Policies/administrative commitment to bullying were related to reduced perpetration among all schools. Findings suggest positive psychosocial climate (from both staff and student perspective) plays a foundational role in bullying prevention, and can optimize effects of stand-alone programs.",2014,,School Psychology Quarterly,29,3,306-319,,10.1037/spq0000073,,#12294,Low 2014,,,No
"Compensating, Mediating, and Moderating Effects of School Climate on Academic Achievement Gaps in Israel","Berkowitz, Ruth; Glickman, Hagit; Benbenishty, Rami; Ben-Artzi, Elisheva; Raz, Tal; Lipshtat, Nurit; Astor, Ron Avi","Background: It is widely agreed among educational researchers and practitioners that schools with positive climates can effectively mitigate the influence of students’ and schools’ socioeconomic status (SES) on academic achievement. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are unclear.Objective: This study aimed to fill that gap, examining student perceptions of school climate, student academic achievement, and student and school SES in Israel to develop a reliable and comprehensive assessment of the role of school climate in the relationship between student and school SES and achievement. Specifically, the study tested whether school climate has an additive contribution to academics beyond students’ and schools’ SES (compensation model), whether the school’s SES influences its social climate, which in turn influences academic achievement (mediation model); or whether the relationship between SES and academics changes across schools with different climates (moderation model). Research Design: Secondary analysis of a large-scale, nationally representative sample of fifth- and eighth-grade Hebrew-speaking students in public schools in Israel (N = 53,946). Data Analysis: Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to examine models with variables both on the student and the school levels. Linear regressions were used to examine student level and school level only models.Results: School climate had an additive compensation contribution to academic achievements, both on the student and the school levels. School climate moderated the relationship between students’ SES and academic achievements. However, findings did not support the hypothesis that school climate mediated the relationship between SES background and academic achievement, both at the student and school levels.Conclusions: School climate plays an important role in accounting for achievements, beyond students’ and schools’ SES. Results highlight the need to improve school climate, especially in schools serving communities of low SES, to enhance social mobility and equality of opportunity.",2015,,Teachers College Record,,,35,,,,#12295,Berkowitz 2015,,,No
A Direct Comparison Approach for Testing Measurement Invariance,"Cheung, Gordon W.; Lau, Rebecca S.","Measurement equivalence/invariance (ME/I) is a condition that should be met before meaningful comparisons of survey results across groups can be made. As an alternative to the likelihood ratio test (LRT), the change in comparative fit index (DCFI) rules of thumb, and the modification index (MI), this teaching note demonstrates the procedures for establishing bias-corrected (BC) bootstrap confidence intervals for testing ME/I. Unlike the LRT and DCFI methods, which need a different model estimation per item, the BC bootstrap confidence intervals approach can examine itemlevel ME/I tests using a single model. This method greatly simplifies the search for an invariant item as the reference indicator in the factor-ratio test. Also demonstrated here is how the factor-ratio test and the list-and-delete method can be extended from the metric invariance test to the scalar invariance test. Finally, the BC bootstrap confidence interval procedures for comparing uniqueness variances, factor variances, factor covariances, and latent means across groups are shown.",2012,,Organizational Research Methods,15,2,167-198,,10.1177/1094428111421987,,#12296,Cheung 2012,,,No

In this cross-sectional investigation, participants were 151 (78 girls; 73 boys) high school students from the southeastern United States who reported on their perceptions of the school’s racial fairness and their engagement. Discipline outcomes were retrieved from school record data. For girls, results revealed a significant indirect relationship (small to medium effect) between perceived racial fairness and office discipline referrals through emotional engagement. For boys, a significant indirect association of perceived racial fairness on office discipline referrals (medium effect) and out-of-school suspensions (large effect) through behavioral engagement was found.

Testing factorial invariance with unbalanced samples,"Yoon, Myeongsun; Lai, Mark H. C.","In testing the factorial invariance of a measure across groups, the groups are often of different sizes. Large imbalances in group size might affect the results of factorial invariance studies and lead to incorrect conclusions of invariance because the ﬁt function in multiple-group factor analysis includes a weighting by group sample size. The implication is that violations of invariance might not be detected if the sample sizes of the 2 groups are severely unbalanced. In this study, we examined the effects of group size differences on results of factorial invariance tests, proposed a subsampling method to address unbalanced sample size issue in factorial invariance studies, and evaluated the proposed approach in various simulation conditions. Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that violations of invariance might be masked in the case of severely unbalanced group size conditions and support the use of the proposed subsampling method to obtain accurate results for invariance studies.",2018,,Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal,25,2,201-213,,10.1080/10705511.2017.1387859,,#12309,Yoon 2018,,,Yes

The authors found that for most indexes the results do not vary depending on which model serves as the correct model. Furthermore, the search for an optimal cut-off value led to anew discovery about the nature of McDonald's measure of centrality and the root mean square error of approximation. Unlike all other indexes considered in this study, the cut-off value of both indexes actually decreases for incorrect models as sample size increases.

Measurement invariance conventions and reporting: The state of the art and future directions for psychological research,"Putnick, Diane L.; Bornstein, Marc H.","Measurement invariance assesses the psychometric equivalence of a construct across groups or across time. Measurement noninvariance suggests that a construct has a different structure or meaning to different groups or on different measurement occasions in the same group, and so the construct cannot be meaningfully tested or construed across groups or across time. Hence, prior to testing mean differences across groups or measurement occasions (e.g., boys and girls, pretest and posttest), or differential relations of the construct across groups, it is essential to assess the invariance of the construct. Conventions and reporting on measurement invariance are still in flux, and researchers are often left with limited understanding and inconsistent advice. Measurement invariance is tested and established in different steps. This report surveys the state of measurement invariance testing and reporting, and details the results of a literature review of studies that tested invariance. Most tests of measurement invariance include configural, metric, and scalar steps; a residual invariance step is reported for fewer tests. Alternative fit indices (AFIs) are reported as model fit criteria for the vast majority of tests; χ2 is reported as the single index in a minority of invariance tests. Reporting AFIs is associated with higher levels of achieved invariance. Partial invariance is reported for about one-third of tests. In general, sample size, number of groups compared, and model size are unrelated to the level of invariance achieved. Implications for the future of measurement invariance testing, reporting, and best practices are discussed.",2016,,Dev Rev,41,,71-90,,10.1016/j.dr.2016.06.004,,#12315,Putnick 2016,,,No

Predicting teacher burnout as a function of school characteristics and irrational beliefs,"Huk, Oksana; Terjesen, Mark D.; Cherkasova, Lina","Irrational beliefs have been linked to negative unhealthy emotions that can contribute to occupational burnout. Maladaptive cognitive schemas, such as irrational beliefs, are theorized to interfere with an appraisal of the perceived balance of resources and demands. The aim of the current study is to investigate the extent to which irrational beliefs account for occupational burnout among high school teachers when considering school resources, job demands, and teacher characteristics. A sample of 79 high school teachers, primarily from New York and New Jersey, completed self‐report questionnaires measuring burnout, the perception of school demands and availability of resources, and irrational beliefs. Among school‐based characteristics, correlational analyses indicated that burnout was positively related to school demands (i.e., student disrespect and student lack of attentiveness) and negatively related to school resources (i.e., support from the administration and colleagues), supporting previous research findings. Among teacher characteristics, burnout was negatively related to self‐efficacy and positively related to irrational beliefs. Results from regression analyses indicated that, whereas irrational beliefs were predictive of teacher burnout, they did not moderate the relationship between demands and burnout.

The scare tactic: Do fear appeals predict motivation and exam scores?,"Putwain, David; Remedios, Richard","Prior to high-stakes exams, teachers use persuasive messages that highlight to students the possible consequences of failure. Such messages are known as fear appeals. This study examined whether fear appeals relate to self- and non-self-determined motivation and academic performance. Data were collected in 3 waves. Self-report data pertaining to perceived fear appeals were collected in the ﬁrst wave, self-report data pertaining to self-determined motivation were collected in the second wave, and exam scores were collected in the third wave. An increased frequency of fear appeals and the appraisal of fear appeals as threatening predicted lower self-determined motivation but were largely unrelated to non-self-determined motivation. An increased frequency of fear appeals and the appraisal of fear appeals as threatening predicted lower examination performance that was partly mediated by lower self-determined motivation. These ﬁndings support a position derived from self-worth theory that the negative consequences of fear appeals arise from their focus on avoiding failure rather than their focus on extrinsic consequences. We suggest that teachers and instructors need to be aware how seemingly motivational statements can unwittingly promote lower self-determined motivation.",2014,,School Psychology Quarterly,29,4,503-516,,10.1037/spq0000048,,#12330,Putwain 2014,,,No

We examined teacher use of consequence and timing reminders, used prior to examinations, and its relation to perceived accountability pressure, teacher self-efficacy, perceived importance of tested outcomes, and the belief that students would interpret such messages as threatening. Data were collected from 854 English primary and secondary school teachers. Results showed that fear appeals and timing reminders were used more frequently when teachers believed that tested outcomes were important, when they had lower self-efficacy to engage students, and when they believed that students would interpret messages as threatening. Timing reminders, but not fear appeals, were used more frequently when perceived accountability pressure was greater. These findings help to understand why teachers are using such behaviours. In this study it was pressures from above, below, and within.",2018,,Soc Psychol Educ,21,5,1001-1019,,10.1007/s11218-018-9448-8,,#12332,Putwain 2018,,,Yes
Cultivating Positive Work Contexts That Promote Teacher Job Satisfaction and Retention in High-Need Schools.,"Ansley, Brandis M.; Houchins, David; Varjas, Kris","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research and/or authorship of this article.

The contents of this report do not necessarily represent the policy of the Department of Education or endorsement by the federal government. • Teacher turnover continues to perpetuate shortages in U.S. schools, particularly within settings that serve students with disabilities, economic disadvantages, or other obstacles to their education. • Recent studies suggest high teacher turnover in high-need settings is not reflective of problems associated with the needs of their students, but instead is a result of high stress and job dissatisfaction due to poor working conditions. • This article reports results of a survey on the working conditions and quality of work experiences of public school teaching staff that served students withmultiple risk factors. The school provided services for students whose least restrictive environment was a separate school for those with intense emotional disturbance needs. In addition, most of the students experienced economic hardship and had histories of childhood trauma, behavior problems, and academic underachievement. • The majority of respondents indicated they were satisfied with their working conditions and quality of work experiences. Correlational analyses revealed that participant job satisfaction wasmost strongly associated with perceptions of supportive school leadership and positive relationships with administrators and other personnel. • Given the survey results and findings of other recent studies, recommendations for practice for special education leaders and administrators in other high-need schools are discussed.

School Personnel and Leadership Collaboration Model for Ideal Work Contexts,"Ansley, Brandis M; Blinder, Melanie; Demere, Josephine; Varjas, Kris; Benson, Gwendolyn; Ogletree, Susan L.","This article describes the school personnel and leadership collaboration (SPLC) model, a shared-responsibility framework for faculty, staff, and administrators. Prior research consistently demonstrates the need for (a) administrative support for teachers and other school personnel and (b) collegial support among staff. The SPLC model represents an amalgamation of this research and, moreover, integrates personnel support for leadership. In the managerial sciences, leader–member exchange (LMX) is a well-known relationship-based leadership approach that focuses on a dyadic or two-way relationship between supervisors and their employees. Though managers are responsible for overseeing operations, personnel contribute ideas, participate in decision-making, and follow through with their responsibilities. LMX is associated with positive work experiences and job performance outcomes. In contrast, schools are often run with a top–down leadership approach that solicits little to no input from staff, leading to low morale, high attrition rates, and negative school climate. Thus, the SPLC model was inspired by LMX and emphasizes practices, such as shared decision-making, staff autonomy, and shared responsibilities. Detailed examples of ways schools may apply the SPLC model to their practices are included.",2019,,JERAP,9,1,,,10.5590/JERAP.2019.09.1.14,,#12334,Ansley 2019,,,Yes
Embedding Staff Self-Care into the MTSS Framework for Those Working in Juvenile Correctional Facilities,"Jolivette, Kristine; Swoszowski, Nicole Cain; Kumm, Skip; Sanders, Sara; Ansley, Brandis M","To address the behavioral needs of youth in juvenile settings, many juvenile agencies and facilities have adopted a multitiered system of supports framework that is predicated on teaching, modeling, and reinforcing expected prosocial behaviors while making data-based decisions with the underlying logic of all (universal, tier one), some (targeted, tier two), and few (intensive, tier three). As the adoption and implementation of this framework has produced positive results (e.g., improved behaviors and increased engagement for youth, improved staff self-efficacy), it has been hypothesized that the tiered framework may be useful when applied to staff as well. Staff within these settings may experience stress and burnout given the facility context and the youth being served. We describe how the tiered framework can be used with staff to address their self-care needs along with some specific strategies per tier from the staff stress and burnout literature.",2019,,,,,19,,,,#12335,Jolivette 2019,,,Yes

Teacher stress interventions may be an important first step toward reducing these negative outcomes. Although there have been several recent intervention studies in the domain of teacher stress, there has been no systematic review to compare the type and effectiveness of teacher stress interventions. Included within this review are interventions from a variety of modalities such as knowledge‐based, behavioral, cognitive‐behavioral, and mindfulness approaches.

Associations between suicidal high school students' help-seeking and their attitudes and perceptions of social environment,"Pisani, Anthony; Schmeelk-Cone, Karen; Gunzler, Douglas; Petrova, Mariya; Goldston, David; Tu, Xin; Wyman, Peter","Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, many of whom fail to disclose suicide concerns to adults who might help. This study examined patterns and predictors of help-seeking behavior among adolescents who seriously considered suicide in the past year. 2,737 students (50.9 % female, 46.9 % male; racial distribution 79.5 % Caucasian, 11.9 % Hispanic/Latino, and 3.6 % Black/African-American) from 12 high schools in rural/underserviced communities were surveyed to assess serious suicide ideation (SI) in the past year, disclosure of SI to adults and peers, attempts to get help, attitudes about help-seeking, perceptions of school engagement, and coping support. Help-seeking was defined as both disclosing SI to an adult and perceiving oneself as seeking help. The relationship between adolescents' help-seeking disclosure and (1) help-seeking attitudes and (2) perceptions of social resources was examined among suicidal help-seeking youth, suicidal non-help-seeking youth, and non-suicidal youth. Of the 381 (14 %) students reporting SI, only 23 % told an adult, 29 % sought adult help, and 15 % did both. Suicidal help-seekers were similar to non-suicidal peers on all measures of help-seeking attitudes and social environment perceptions. Positive attitudes about help-seeking from adults at school, perceptions that adults would respond to suicide concerns, willingness to overcome peer secrecy requests, and greater coping support and engagement with the school were associated with students' increased disclosure of SI and help-seeking. This study supports prevention strategies that change student norms, attitudes and social environments to promote help-seeking among adolescents with SI. Promising intervention targets include increasing students' perceptions of the availability and capability of adults to help them, and strengthening students' understanding of how existing resources can help them cope.",2012,,Journal of Youth & Adolescence,41,10,1312-1324,,10.1007/s10964-012-9766-7,,#12339,Pisani 2012,,,No
The Relationship Between School Climate and Mental and Emotional Wellbeing Over the Transition from Primary to Secondary School,"Lester, Leanne; Cross, Donna","Background:  School climate has often been described as the “quality and character of school life”, including both social and physical aspects of the school, that can positively promote behaviour, school achievement, and the social and emotional development of students.Methods:  The current study examined the relationship between students’ mental and emotional wellbeing and factors pertaining to school climate, focussing on the domains of safety, social relationships and school connectedness, during the last year of their primary schooling (age 11–12 years) and their first 2 years of secondary school. Data was collected using a self-completion questionnaire, four times over 3 years from 1800 students’ aged 11–14 years. Multilevel modelling was used to determine the strongest school climate predictor of students’ mental and emotional wellbeing at each time point.Results:  In the last year of primary school, peer support was the strongest protective predictor of wellbeing, while feeling less connected and less safe at school predicted mental wellbeing. Feeling safe at school was the strongest protective factor for student wellbeing in the first year of secondary school. In the second year of secondary school, peer support was the strongest protective factor for mental wellbeing, while feeling safe at school, feeling connected to school and having support from peers were predictive of emotional wellbeing.Conclusions:  School climate factors of feeling safe at school, feeling connected to school, and peer support are all protective of mental and emotional wellbeing over the transition period while connectedness to teachers is protective of emotional wellbeing. Primary school appears to be an important time to establish quality connections to peers who have a powerful role in providing support for one another before the transition to secondary school. However, school policies and practices promoting safety and encouraging and enabling connectedness are important during the first years of secondary school. Recommendations for effective school policy and practice in both primary and secondary schools to help enhance the mental and emotional wellbeing of adolescents are discussed.",2015,,Psych Well-Being,5,1,9,,10.1186/s13612-015-0037-8,,#12340,Lester 2015,,,Yes
"Classroom management, school staff relations, school climate, and academic achievement: testing a model with urban high schools","Back, Lindsey T.; Polk, Elizabeth; Keys, Christopher; McMahon, Susan","Urban learning environments pose distinct instructional challenges for teachers and administrators, and can lead to lower achievement compared to suburban or rural schools. Today's educational climate increasingly emphasises a need for positive academic outcomes, often measured by standardised tests, on which student educational opportunities, teacher benefits and school funding can be based. By applying an ecological framework to the urban school environment, it could be possible to better understand and ultimately improve the educational context at multiple levels. This study examined how classroom management, staff relations and school climate contribute to academic achievement, as measured by ACT scores. In a large urban American public school system, 208 teachers from 38 high schools were surveyed. A model was tested in which, when academic achievement was accounted for over time, classroom management and staff relations contributed positively to school climate, and climate in turn contributed to academic achievement. Structural equation modeling revealed that the data fitted the proposed model. Results illustrate the roles of school and classroom factors related to academic performance and underline the importance of classroom management strategies and positive learning environments. Results suggest avenues for interventions to increase academic achievement by supporting students through the lens of an ecological framework.",2016,,Learning Environments Research,19,3,397-410,,10.1007/s10984-016-9213-x,,#12341,Back 2016,,,No

Relationships Between Perceived School Climate and Adolescent Mental Health Across Genders,"Suldo, Shannon M.; McMahan, Melanie M.; Chappel, Ashley M.; Loker, Troy","The current study explored the relationship between school climate perceptions and self-reported mental health among 415 high school students. Mental health was deﬁned comprehensively via indicators of positive functioning (life satisfaction) and psychopathology (internalizing and externalizing problems). Regression analyses indicated that students’ perceptions of six dimensions of school climate (sharing of resources, order and discipline, parent involvement, school building appearance, student interpersonal relations, and student–teacher relations) accounted for a total of 15–22 % of the variance in indicators of their mental health, above and beyond between-school differences in outcomes. Bivariate links emerged between positive perceptions of each school climate dimension and better mental health. Parent involvement was the most consistent unique predictor of mental health. Worse perceptions of the peer interpersonal relations, equal sharing of school resources, and physical appearance of one’s school building uniquely predicted greater psychopathology (externalizing and internalizing problems, respectively), whereas teacher–student relations were particularly associated with wellness (among girls only). Across indicators, school climate was more highly associated with girls’ mental health. Directions for future research and implications for educators are discussed.",2012,,School Mental Health,4,2,69-80,,10.1007/s12310-012-9073-1,,#12345,Suldo 2012,,,No
"Relationships between school climate, bullying and delinquent behaviours","Aldridge, Jill M.; McChesney, Katrina; Afari, Ernest","Given that schools are, potentially, powerful sites for inﬂuencing adolescent behaviour, it is important that there is greater understanding of the psychosocial aspects of the school climate that can be leveraged for this purpose. The research reported in this article used structural equation modelling (with data from a sample of 6120 students at Australian high schools) to examine the inﬂuence of the psychosocial school-level environment on students’ self-reported experiences of bully victimisation (i.e. being victims of bullying) and engagement in delinquent behaviours. Further, we examined whether bully victimisation mediated the relationships between school climate variables and delinquent behaviours. School connectedness and rule clarity were negatively associated with both bully victimisation and delinquency (p \ 0.05), and teacher support was negatively associated with bully victimisation (p \ 0.01), conﬁrming the importance of these aspects of the school-level environment. However, afﬁrming diversity and reporting and seeking help both had positive inﬂuences on bully victimisation (p \ 0.05), raising concerns about the ways in which these aspects of the school-level environment might have been promoted. Importantly, bully victimisation was found to mediate the inﬂuence of ﬁve of the six school climate constructs on delinquent behaviours (p \ 0.001). This study advance our understanding of how speciﬁc aspects of the school climate inﬂuence the prevalence of bullying and delinquent behaviour, adding weight to the call for educators to actively monitor and enhance psychosocial aspects of the school climate in order to improve student behavioural outcomes.",2018,,Learning Environ Res,21,2,153-172,,10.1007/s10984-017-9249-6,,#12346,Aldridge 2018,,,Yes
The school environment and student health: a systematic review and meta-ethnography of qualitative research,"Jamal, Farah; Fletcher, Adam; Harden, Angela; Wells, Helene; Thomas, James; Bonell, Chris","Background: There is increasing interest in promoting young people’s health by modifying the school environment. However, existing research offers little guidance on how the school context enables or constrains students’ health behaviours, or how students’ backgrounds relate to these processes. For these reasons, this paper reports on a meta-ethnography of qualitative studies examining: through what processes does the school environment (social and physical) influence young people’s health?Methods: Systematic review of qualitative studies. Sixteen databases were searched, eliciting 62, 329 references which were screened, with included studies quality assessed, data extracted and synthesized using an adaptation of Noblit and Hare’s meta-ethnographic approach.Results: Nineteen qualitative studies were synthesised to explore processes through which school-level influences on young people’s health might occur. Four over-arching meta-themes emerged across studies focused on a range of different health issues. First, aggressive behaviour and substance use are often a strong source of status and bonding at schools where students feel educationally marginalised or unsafe. Second, health-risk behaviours are concentrated in unsupervised ‘hotspots’ at the school. Third, positive relationships with teachers appear to be critical in promoting student wellbeing and limiting risk behaviour; however, certain aspects of schools’ organisation and education policies constrain this, increasing the likelihood that students look for a sense of identity and social support via health-risk behaviours. Fourth, unhappiness at school can cause students to seek sources of ‘escape’, either by leaving school at lunchtime or for longer unauthorized spells or through substance use. These meta-themes resonate with Markham and Aveyard’s theory of human functioning and school organisation, and we draw on these qualitative data to refine and extend this theory, in particular conceptualising more fully the role of young people’s agency and student-led ‘systems’ in constituting school environments and generating health risks.Conclusion: Institutional features which may shape student health behaviours such as lack of safety, poor studentstaff relationships and lack of student voice are amenable to interventions and should be the subject of future investigation. Future qualitative research should focus on health behaviours which are under-theorised in this context such as physical activity, sexual and mental health.",2013,,BMC Public Health,13,1,798,,10.1186/1471-2458-13-798,,#12347,Jamal 2013,,,Yes

A systematic review of the effectiveness of mental health promotion interventions for young people in low and middle income countries,"Barry, Margaret M; Clarke, Aleisha M; Jenkins, Rachel; Patel, Vikram","Background: This systematic review provides a narrative synthesis of the evidence on the effectiveness of mental health promotion interventions for young people in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Commissioned by the WHO, a review of the evidence for mental health promotion interventions across the lifespan from early years to adulthood was conducted. This paper reports on the findings for interventions promoting the positive mental health of young people (aged 6–18 years) in school and community-based settings.Methods: Searching a range of electronic databases, 22 studies employing RCTs (N = 11) and quasi-experimental designs conducted in LMICs since 2000 were identified. Fourteen studies of school-based interventions implemented in eight LMICs were reviewed; seven of which included interventions for children living in areas of armed conflict and six interventions of multicomponent lifeskills and resilience training. Eight studies evaluating out-of-school community interventions for adolescents were identified in five countries. Using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) criteria, two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the evidence.Results: The findings from the majority of the school-based interventions are strong. Structured universal interventions for children living in conflict areas indicate generally significant positive effects on students’ emotional and behavioural wellbeing, including improved self-esteem and coping skills. However, mixed results were also reported, including differential effects for gender and age groups, and two studies reported nonsignficant findings. The majority of the school-based lifeskills and resilience programmes received a moderate quality rating, with findings indicating positive effects on students’ self-esteem, motivation and self-efficacy. The quality of evidence from the community-based interventions for adolescents was moderate to strong with promising findings concerning the potential of multicomponent interventions to impact on youth mental health and social wellbeing.Conclusions: The review findings indicate that interventions promoting the mental health of young people can be implemented effectively in LMIC school and community settings with moderate to strong evidence of their impact on both positive and negative mental health outcomes. There is a paucity of evidence relating to interventions for younger children in LMIC primary schools. Evidence for the scaling up and sustainability of mental health promotion interventions in LMICs needs to be strengthened.",2013,,,,,19,,,,#12349,Barry 2013,,,Yes

Three-level hierarchical linear models indicated that perceptions of available emotional and service supports, rules and consequences, and parent engagement were positively related to adolescents’ future orientation.

"Student Self-Efficacy, Classroom Engagement, and Academic Achievement: Comparing Three Theoretical Frameworks","Olivier, E.; Archambault, I.; De Clercq, M.; Galand, B.","Student self-efﬁcacy, behavioral engagement, and emotional engagement are key factors for academic achievement. Research has yet to identify the developmental cascades linking these four constructs. Three theoretical frameworks, i.e., Self-Efﬁcacy Theory, the Self-System Model of Motivational Development, and Expectancy-Value Theory, suggest different nexus. Following 671 students (51.8% girls) from their 4th to 6th grade, this study aims to assess competing hypotheses from these three frameworks in math. Three cross-lag models were tested to test each theoretical framework. A fourth and ﬁnal model was tested to include the signiﬁcant paths from the previous models. Mediation paths were also tested. Results mainly support assumptions from Self-Efﬁcacy Theory, that is student self-efﬁcacy and academic achievement are mutually associated from 4th to 6th grades. Some of the propositions of Expectancy-Value Theory were also supported. Self-efﬁcacy was associated with later emotional engagement and academic achievement. However, emotional engagement in 5th grade was negatively associated with achievement in 6th grade and was not associated with behavioral engagement. Assumptions from the SelfSystem Model were not supported by the data. Testing the fourth model revealed an unexpected developmental cascade: 5thgrade self-efﬁcacy mediated the association between 4th-grade achievement and 6th-grade emotional engagement. This last ﬁnding may have great implications for young adolescents as emotional engagement is an indicator of student well-being and intrinsic value of learning. Implications for theory validation and intervention targets for adolescents are discussed.",2019,,J Youth Adolescence,48,2,326-340,,10.1007/s10964-018-0952-0,,#12351,Olivier 2019,,,No

This paper examined the longitudinal effect of SW-PBIS on student behavioral problems and academic achievement growth in elementary and middle schools using propensity score matching. We found no statistically significant longitudinal effects of SW-PBIS on either student behavior problems or academic achievement among elementary and middle schools in this quasi-experimental design, even though the positive direction of longitudinal changes would be identified. The result raised questions about the efficacy of SW-PBIS using a statewide achievement test when scaled up to a state level.

Systems View of School Climate: a Theoretical Framework for Research,"Rudasill, Kathleen Moritz; Snyder, Kate E.; Levinson, Heather; L. Adelson, Jill","School climate has been widely examined through both empirical and theoretical means. However, there is little conceptual consensus underlying the landscape of this literature, offering inconsistent guidance for research examining this important construct. In order to best assist the efforts of developing causal models that describe how school climate functions, we propose the Systems View of School Climate (SVSC). This theoretical framework was formed by deconstructing prior models and empirical research on school climate into themes and highlighting their implicit assumptions. Using the SVSC to synthesize this existing literature, school climate is defined as the affective and cognitive perceptions regarding social interactions, relationships, values, and beliefs held by students, teachers, administrators, and staff within a school. School climate is situated within Ecological Systems Theory (Bronfenbrenner 1989) to guide future research in this domain and help specify levels of research or analysis, thereby providing utility as a theoretical framework for future causal models. The SVSC provides a roadmap for research by demarcating school climate from related constructs, suggesting related contextual and structural constructs, and delineating proximal and distal systems which may shape the nature of school climate.",2018,,Educ Psychol Rev,30,1,35-60,,10.1007/s10648-017-9401-y,,#12355,Rudasill 2018,,,Yes
What schools need to know about fostering school belonging: A meta-analysis,"Allen, Kelly; Kern, Margaret L.; Vella-Brodrick, Dianne; Hattie, John; Waters, Lea","Belonging is an essential aspect of psychological functioning. Schools offer unique opportunities to improve belonging for school-aged children. Research on school belonging, however, has been fragmented and diluted by inconsistency in the use of terminology. To resolve some of these inconsistencies, the current study uses meta-analysis of individual and social level factors that influence school belonging. These findings aim to provide guidance on the factors schools should emphasise to best support students. First, a systematic review identified 10 themes that influence school belonging at the student level during adolescence in educational settings (academic motivation, emotional stability, personal characteristics, parent support, peer support, teacher support, gender, race and ethnicity, extracurricular activities and environmental/school safety). Second, the average association between each of these themes and school belonging was meta-analytically examined across 51 studies (N = 67,378). Teacher support and positive personal characteristics were the strongest predictors of school belonging. Results varied by geographic location, with effects generally stronger in rural than in urban locations.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Cyber-Victimization and Educational Outcomes for Adolescents,"Gardella, Joseph H.; Fisher, Benjamin W.; Teurbe-Tolon, Abbie R.","Adolescents’ Internet use is increasingly mobile, private, and unsupervised, which raises concerns given that the Internet increasingly serves as a medium for experiencing victimization. Although it is widely recognized that in-person victimization has a deleterious effect on adolescents’ educational outcomes, the extent to which cyber-victimization has similar effects is less well known. This systematic review and meta-analysis offers a synthesis of the relationship between cyber-victimization and educational outcomes of adolescents aged 12 to 17, including 25 effect sizes from 12 studies drawn from a variety of disciplines. A series of random-effects meta-analyses using robust variance estimation revealed associations between cyber-victimization and higher school attendance problems (r = .20) and academic achievement problems (r = .14). Results did not differ by provided definition, publication status, reporting time frame, gender, race/ethnicity, or average age.

"Engaging Marginalized, “At-Risk” Middle-Level Students: A Focus on the Importance of a Sense of Belonging at School","Pendergast, Donna; Allen, Jeanne; McGregor, Glenda; Ronksley-Pavia, Michelle","The philosophy of middle level education is to intentionally create a learning environment that supports every young adolescent. The literature around engagement points to the need for students to experience (among other requirements) a sense of belonging at school (SOBAS). When the need for belonging is not achieved there may be signiﬁcant consequences, including an impact on intellectual performance, and hence, learning potential may not be achieved. For students with marginalized identities, an intensiﬁcation of factors that create challenges places them at-risk of disengaging and their sense of belonging at school is more likely to be compromised. Nurturing SOBAS is positively associated with the retention of students who are at-risk of dropping out of, thereby being an aspirational goal of education. Methods: The ﬁndings of a systematic literature review related to young adolescents and the importance of SOBAS forms a focused literature base. We highlight ﬁndings from a study that explored the effectiveness of engagement strategies for marginalized students in one educational jurisdiction in Australia. Data in the form of a series of interviews and focus groups conducted with 25 students, 25 of their teachers, and 39 school leaders provides a rich data set for thematic content analysis. Inductive analysis and in vivo coding led to a framework that summarized each of the sub-group data sets to convey emergent themes. Results: Five themes related to SOBAS emerged from the data: (a) Relationships in School; (b) School Climate; (c) Pedagogical Practices; (d) Speciﬁc Programs and Activities; and (e) Other Issues, mainly variables such as family, mental health, trauma and poverty that impacted on a student’s SOBAS. Conclusion: The systematic literature review and the ﬁndings of the empirical study presented in this paper highlight aspects of SOBAS that can be formalized into a series of strategies to increase retention of marginalized students.",2018,,Education Sciences,8,3,138,,10.3390/educsci8030138,,#12360,Pendergast 2018,,,Yes
"The Effect of Principal Behaviors on Student, Teacher, and School Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Empirical Literature","Liebowitz, David D.; Porter, Lorna","Principals are understood to be critical actors in improving teaching and learning conditions in schools; however, relatively little is known about the leadership strategies to which principals should dedicate their time and effort to improve outcomes. We review the empirical literature from 51 studies of principal behaviors and student, teacher, and school outcomes and conduct a meta-analysis of these relationships. Our analysis has three central findings: (1) we find direct evidence of the relationship between principal behaviors and student achievement (0.08–0.16 SD), teacher well-being (0.34–0.38 SD), teacher instructional practices (0.35 SD), and school organizational health (0.72–0.81 SD); (2) we highlight the importance of principal behaviors beyond instructional management as potential tools to improve student achievement outcomes; and (3) the preceding findings are based almost entirely on observational studies because the causal evidence base on school leadership behaviors is nonexistent. We argue our findings suggest value in investing in school leadership capacities. We conclude by discussing opportunities to improve the quality of future research examining the relationship between principal behaviors and student, teacher, and school outcomes.",2019,,Review of Educational Research,89,5,785-827,,10.3102/0034654319866133,,#12361,Liebowitz 2019,,,Yes
Systematic Review of Key Leader Practices Found to Influence Student Achievement: A Unified Framework,"Hitt, Dallas Hambrick; Tucker, Pamela D.","The field of educational leadership has accrued a body of research that explains how leaders influence student achievement through the enactment of various practices. Yet, differences exist in the substance of the frameworks that assert the areas to which leaders should attend. The specific purposes of this article are to identify and synthesize the empirical research on how leadership influences student achievement and to provide evidence on how school leaders should direct their efforts. During the literature review, we consulted experts for recommendations and searched peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2014. The literature review yielded 56 empirical research studies of relevance to the topic and 3 frameworks consisting of clustered practices. We then grouped the 28 practices according to systematic criteria and found 5 overarching domains. In doing so, this study unifies existing frameworks through developing a cohesive set of practices to inform the work of researchers and practitioners.",2016,,Review of Educational Research,86,2,531-569,,10.3102/0034654315614911,,#12362,Hitt 2016,,,Yes
The Accountability Culture: a Systematic Review of High-Stakes Testing and English Learners in the United States During No Child Left Behind,"Acosta, Sandra; Garza, Tiberio; Hsu, Hsien-Yuan; Goodson, Patricia; Padrón, Yolanda; Goltz, Heather H.; Johnston, Anna","The purpose of our study was twofold: (1) to review the literature on high-stakes accountability testing and English learners (ELs) in the USA, applying qualitative systematic review methodology, and (2) to draw substantive conclusions about the impact of high-stakes accountability testing on ELs, reported in studies published between 2001 and 2016. Thirty-seven studies (n = 37) meeting the eligibility criteria were evaluated using the Methodological Quality Questionnaire. Findings indicate construct irrelevant variance (non-random factors that systematically affect ELs’ test performance) challenges the appropriateness of inferences drawn about ELs’ content knowledge based on assessment performance. Further, language policy in schools, driven by high-stakes tests, promotes increased instructional time for basic skills tutorials with fewer opportunities for problem solving and other higher-order learning activities. Moreover, theory utilization was rare (n = 8, 22%). Among studies that utilized theory, few explicitly referenced it to discuss study findings.",2020,,Educ Psychol Rev,32,2,327-352,,10.1007/s10648-019-09511-2,,#12363,Acosta 2020,,,No
Associations Between Language and Problem Behavior: a Systematic Review and Correlational Meta-analysis,"Chow, Jason C.; Wehby, Joseph H.","A growing body of evidence points to the common co-occurrence of language and behavioral difficulties in children. Primary studies often focus on this relation in children with identified deficits. However, it is unknown whether this relation holds across other children at risk or representative samples of children or over time. The purpose of this paper is to describe the results of a systematic review and two metaanalyses exploring the concurrent and predictive associations between language ability and problem behavior in school-age children. A systematic literature search yielded 1655 unduplicated abstracts, and a structured study selection process resulted in 19 eligible reports and 25 effect sizes for the concurrent analysis and 8 reports and 10 effect sizes for the predictive analysis. Eligible reports were then coded, and effect sizes were extracted and synthesized via random effects meta-analyses. Results estimate significant negative concurrent (z = −0.17 [−0.21, −0.13]) and predictive (z = −0.17 [−0.21, −0.13]) associations between language and problem behavior, and these relations hold across age, time, and risk status. Mean effect sizes for receptive and expressive language were significant. This study adds to the quantitative and descriptive literature by summarizing and corroborating the evidence that low language ability is associated with problem behavior. Further research is needed relative to differences in subconstructs of language and behavior, as well as a focus on intervention for students with these comorbid deficits.",2018,,Educ Psychol Rev,30,1,61-82,,10.1007/s10648-016-9385-z,,#12364,Chow 2018,,,No
Incorporating physical activity‐based interventions in school psychology research and practice: A systematic review,"Greenspan, Scott B.; Fefer, Sarah A.; Whitcomb, Sara A.; Kemp, Jessica M.","Physical activity provides a myriad of well‐documented socialemotional, behavioral, and academic benefits for youth. While research suggests that physical activity should be integrated within the school day to support the well‐being of students, an understanding of related empirical work within school psychology research and practice is unclear. School psychologists are well positioned to systematically incorporate physical activity within their intervention practices, particularly given their role and expertise in implementing and evaluating interventions. Authors engaged in a systematic review of 20 years (1998–2018) of physical activity intervention research within 10 peer‐reviewed school psychology journals and six school psychology‐related journals. Authors analyzed 22 studies to glean a comprehensive understanding of the literature base and highlight the ways in which physical activity can be incorporated to support school and student outcomes.

Results indicated that the strength of the PAS relation was stronger when PAS was reflective of both parents, rather than of just mothers or just fathers among five of six outcomes for which moderators could be examined. Moderator analyses also suggested that PAS correlations are stronger when the outcome is better aligned to the predictor and the relation between PAS and psychosocial outcomes may vary by grade level.

Studies that experimentally investigated the effectiveness of CICO or modified CICO compared with a baseline or control condition on student outcomes were included. A between‐case d‐statistic comparable across single‐case and between‐groups experiments was calculated for 59 dependent variables across 32 studies. The meta‐analysis was conducted using robust variance estimation allowing for the inclusion of multiple effect sizes per study by accounting for dependency between outcomes. The overall effect size, g̅ = 1.22, 95% confidence intervals (1.00, 1.44), suggested CICO improves student outcomes by over one standard deviation. Studies were characterized by considerable heterogeneity that went largely unexplained in moderator analyses.

Evaluating the Relationship Between Boredom and Academic Outcomes: A Meta-Analysis,"Tze, Virginia M. C.; Daniels, Lia M.; Klassen, Robert M.","The experience of academic boredom among students may be universal; in fact, almost all students complain at least occasionally about being bored in class or while studying. Despite the perceived negative influence of boredom on learning, there has been no synthesis of empirical findings underscoring how boredom relates to academic outcomes. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to meta-analyze the research exploring the relationship between students’ academic boredom and their motivation, study strategies and behaviors, and performance. A total of 29 studies, involving 19,052 students, met the inclusion criteria. The overall effect size, r = −.24, was significant, p < .001. In subgroup analyses, the negative effect sizes were found to differ between secondary and post-secondary students, and boredom experienced in class had greater negative impact on students’ academic outcomes than boredom experienced while studying. In addition, a significant differential impact of boredom on academic motivation, study strategies and behaviors, and achievement was found. These findings suggest that education professionals should identify strategies to alleviate students’ boredom in academic settings.",2016,,Educ Psychol Rev,28,1,119-144,,10.1007/s10648-015-9301-y,,#12368,Tze 2016,,,Yes

A Meta-Analysis of the Effects of Teacher Personality on Teacher Effectiveness and Burnout,"Kim, Lisa E.; Jörg, Verena; Klassen, Robert M.","The question of what makes a good teacher has been asked by practitioners, policymakers, and researchers for decades. However, there is no guiding framework about which qualities are important for teachers. Thus, it is necessary to examine these qualities using a recognized framework and to summarize the previous literature on this topic. We conducted a metaanalysis on the 25 studies (total N = 6294) reporting the relationships between teacher Big Five personality domains (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and emotional stability) and two teacher job-related outcomes (i.e., teacher effectiveness and burnout). Furthermore, the influence of three moderators was assessed, namely, the type of teacher effectiveness measure (i.e., evaluations of teaching, student performance self-efficacy, classroom observation, and academic achievement), source of personality report (i.e., self-report vs other-report), and the instructed educational level (i.e., elementary, secondary, and tertiary). Overall, teacher Big Five domains (except for agreeableness) were positively associated with teacher effectiveness, especially for evaluations of teaching. Furthermore, teacher emotional stability, extraversion, and conscientiousness were negatively associated with burnout. Otherreports of teacher personality were more strongly associated with outcomes than self-reports. There were no differences in the strength of the associations between the educational levels. The need for using common descriptors in teacher research as well as practical implications of the findings for teacher personality measurement is discussed.",2019,,Educ Psychol Rev,31,1,163-195,,10.1007/s10648-018-9458-2,,#12371,Kim 2019,,,No

Associations between peer victimization and school climate: The impact of form and the moderating role of gender,"Williford, Anne; Fite, Paula J.; Isen, Debbie; Poquiz, Jonathan","The purpose of the present study is to examine whether physical and relational victimization negatively impacts indicators of school climate–students’ perceptions of school safety, their attachment to school, and their help‐seeking behavior–and whether gender moderates these associations. Using a sample of 361 third through fifth‐grade students recruited from six public elementary schools, results reveal that relational and physical victimization were both uniquely associated with lower levels of school safety and school attachment, with stronger associations between school attachment and relational victimization. However, only physical victimization was negatively associated with help‐seeking, suggesting that physical victimization is more influential on help seeking as compared with relational victimization. Gender moderated the relationships between victimization and school attachment and help‐seeking with differences by form noted. No gender differences were evident in associations between the forms of peer victimization and school safety.

Although students in kindergarten through second grade do not take high-stakes assessments, early elementary teachers reported high levels of stress associated with test-based accountability policies. This study provides data across multiple states that test-based accountability policies may have negative influences on school environment and teacher stress among early elementary teachers. Implications for practice and research are discussed.",2018,,Psychol. Schs.,55,4,391-403,,10.1002/pits.22112,,#12385,Saeki 2018,,,No
The relation of social skills and school climate of diversity to children's life satisfaction: The mediating role of school connectedness,"In, Hyoyeon; Kim, Hyunhee; Carney, JoLynn V.","The present study examined the role of school connectedness in mediating the relations of social skills and school climate of diversity (SCD) to life satisfaction (LS) among school‐aged children. This study also investigated whether there is any gender difference in relationships. Participants included 873 elementary school students in Grades 4 through 6. The results of the structural equation modeling supported the partial mediating role of school connectedness, indicating that social skills and SCD lead to LS both directly and indirectly through enhanced school connectedness. Multigroup analysis demonstrated that the direct path from the SCD to LS was significant only for boys, while other paths are invariant across gender.

Towards a healthy school climate: The mediating effect of transformational leadership on cultural intelligence and organisational health,"Velarde, Joseph M; Ghani, Muhammad Faizal; Adams, Donnie; Cheah, Jun-Hwa","In the ever-changing 21st-century landscape characterised by emerging global and technical trends, the search for relevant leaders in school systems relies on the premises of building a conducive, adaptive and inclusive learning environment. Thus, this article aims to examine the mediating effect of transformational leadership attributes of school leaders on their cultural intelligence and the organisational health of secondary schools in Kuala Lumpur. Using a quantitative design, a survey questionnaire was administered to 476 school leaders in Kuala Lumpur. The results from the survey were analysed using PLS-SEM technique with SmartPLS software, which established the direct effects of cultural intelligence on transformational leadership and organisational health. In addition, transformational leadership was determined to have a direct effect on organisational health. The evaluation of the structural model revealed that transformational leadership has a mediating effect on cultural intelligence of school leaders and organisational health of secondary schools. Aside from advancing the theoretical understanding of school leadership, the results of this article present reflection points for current and aspiring school leaders, opportunities for inclusion of cultural understanding in school leadership programs, and provisions in policies in organisational development in multicultural schools.",2022,,Educational Management Administration & Leadership,50,1,163-184,,10.1177/1741143220937311,,#12390,Velarde 2022,,,No

The present study leverages EDSCLS data from 3,416 students from 26 middle and high schools in Washington, DC to confirm the factor structure of the survey using both single-level and multilevel confirmatory factor analyses. At the individual level, our findings paralleled those from the original validation study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. At the school level, our findings suggested a simpler factor structure for the engagement and environment domains, and could not identify a reasonable well-fitting model for the safety domain.

The Impact of School Climate on Well-Being Experience and School Engagement: A Study With High-School Students,"Lombardi, Elisabetta; Traficante, Daniela; Bettoni, Roberta; Offredi, Ilaria; Giorgetti, Marisa; Vernice, Mirta","The aim of this work is to investigate the factors promoting students’ engagement at school and supporting their well-being experience. According to the Positive Education there is a strong relationship between school environment and student’s well-being. Moreover, the quality of the school climate perceived by the students was found to inﬂuence engagement in school activities, as well. In this study, 153 students (M = 67) attending 10th grade were presented with tests and questionnaires to assess individual assets (personality traits, literacy skills), emerging appraisals (school-climate, well-being experience) and emerging actions (school engagement), according to the Student Well-Being Model. Path analysis showed that the best model does include neither individual assets nor direct effect of school climate on engagement, as the effect of school climate on engagement is mediated by well-being experience. The main result is that school climate has been conﬁrmed as an important factor to be considered to improve engagement in school activities, but it is effective only when its inﬂuence can modify the well-being experience of the students. Moreover, the lack of signiﬁcant effects of individual assets in the model suggests that improving school climate means to support well-being experience and, indirectly school engagement, irrespective to learning abilities and personality traits. This work encourages working in/with schools to implement positive education programs that support and sustain a positive school climate and culture for school-community wellbeing.",2019,,Front.

Are perceived school climate dimensions predictive of students’ engagement?,"Fatou, Nicolas; Kubiszewski, Violaine","Students’ engagement is known to be associated with academic success and to prevent school dropouts. While many studies have considered this variable when examining school trajectories, more research is needed to investigate the factors that may sustain and promote engagement in school, regarded as a multidimensional construct (affective vs. cognitive vs. behavioral engagement). In the present cross-sectional study, associations between students’ perceptions of school climate dimensions and their level of engagement were explored. The differential effects on these associations of sex and social background were also examined. Results from a sample of 955 high-school students showed that a model incorporating six dimensions of perceived school climate explained a large proportion of the variance in students’ engagement, especially affective engagement. The perceived climate of relations between teachers and students appeared to be highly predictive of students’ engagement. Analyses also revealed that the predictiveness of school climate factors for affective, cognitive and behavioral engagement varied slightly according to sex and social background.

Tests of measurement invariance/equivalence (MI/E) of parenting measures can help evaluate the validity of parenting constructs among racial/ethnic minorities. This systematic review summarized studies on MI/E of parenting constructs by race/ethnicity and evaluated the strength of the evidence. A literature search was conducted using various databases and references to retrieve studies from the United States. Indeed, 10 studies were identified that tested for MI/E of eight parenting scales by race/ethnicity. Only one scale showed moderate evidence of MI/E, five showed weak evidence of MI/E, and two showed no evidence of MI/E. Most studies (80%) used factor analytic methods to test for MI/E, but only two studies (20%) examined all levels of invariance. These findings show that differences exist in how racial/ethnic minorities perceive parenting constructs. Further research is needed to develop more inclusive parenting measures, to protect against the ways in which biased measures may pathologize or misrepresent parenting practices among racial/ethnic minorities.",2021,,Assessment,,,10731911211038630,,10.1177/10731911211038630,,#12403,Rodriguez 2021,,,Yes
Systematic Review: The Measurement Properties of the Children’s Depression Rating Scale−Revised in Adolescents With Major Depressive Disorder,"Stallwood, Emma; Monsour, Andrea; Rodrigues, Craig; Monga, Suneeta; Terwee, Caroline; Offringa, Martin; Butcher, Nancy J.","ObjectiveTo systematically appraise existing evidence of the measurement properties of the Children’s Depression Rating Scale−Revised (CDRS-R) in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD). The CDRS-R is the most commonly used scale in adolescent depression research, yet was originally designed for use in children 6 to 12 years old.MethodSeven databases were searched for studies that evaluated the measurement properties of the CDRS-R in adolescents (ages 12−18 years). Of 65 studies screened by full-text, 6 were included. Measurement properties were appraised using the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. The COSMIN minimum requirements for recommending the use of an outcome measurement instrument are (1) evidence for sufficient content validity (any level of evidence), and (2) at least low-quality evidence for sufficient internal consistency.ResultsFour studies assessed an English-language version of the CDRS-R; the other 2 assessed German and Korean versions, respectively. No study assessed content validity, cross-cultural validity/measurement invariance, or measurement error of the CDRS-R in adolescents with MDD. Low-quality evidence was found for sufficient construct validity (n = 4 studies) and responsiveness (n = 2 studies) assessed via comparator instruments. Very-low−quality evidence was found for sufficient interrater reliability (n = 2 studies). The results for structural validity (n = 3 studies) and internal consistency (n = 5 studies) were inconclusive.ConclusionIt remains unclear whether the CDRS-R appropriately measures depressive symptom severity in adolescent MDD. Before use of the CDRS-R in adolescent MDD research can be recommended, evidence of sufficient psychometric properties in adolescents with MDD is needed.",2021,,Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,60,1,119-133,,10.1016/j.jaac.2020.10.009,,#12404,Stallwood 2021,,,Yes

The Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM‐28) was developed as a cross‐cultural measure of resilience and has been used globally. To examine the cross‐cultural utility of the CYRM‐28, we conducted a systematic review of the literature reporting on the psychometric properties of the measure. Using data representing six countries (N = 6,232) that were supplied from authors of the studies reviewed, a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was also conducted to estimate the variability of the measurement properties among communities, ages, and sex. Results indicate that the literature generally did not include reliability and validity information for the instrument.

Investigation of a bifactor model of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire,"Caci, Hervé; Morin, Alexandre; Tran, Antoine","The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is used to measure psychopathological symptoms in children and adolescents from 4 to 17 years old, but its underlying structure is still a matter of debate. Indeed, on the basis of a systematic review of English and non-English articles conducted using multiple databases, 54 studies reporting on the factor structure of the SDQ were located. The original 5 first-order factor structure is generally supported by exploratory procedures, but support based on confirmatory factor analyses is not clear. We analysed data from 889 youths from the general French population, rated on the SDQ by their teachers. We tested the original model, hierarchical models and bifactor models. The best-fitting model is a bifactor model with the five a priori factors grouped in two global factors (Externalizing Disorders-Hyperactivity and Conduct-and Internalizing Disorders-Peer relationships and Emotions) and one Strength/Prosocial factor. However, we show that the Conduct-Specific factor should not be used in practice in its current state, that the Hyperactivity-Specific factor mainly covers hyperactivity rather than inattention, and that the Peer Problems-Specific factor mainly reflects a preference for solitude. Nevertheless, the measurement model proved to be fully invariant across gender and school levels (kindergarten, primary and secondary schools), with statistically significant differences in latent means between genders only. Beyond computing the five a priori scores when using the teacher ratings of the SDQ, our results prove the usefulness of computing Externalizing Disorders and Internalizing Disorders global scores.",2015,,European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,24,10,1291-1301,,10.1007/s00787-015-0679-3,,#12406,Caci 2015,,,No

Methods (1) We searched for studies of MI among different chronic conditions in online databases. (2) Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses were used to study MI among five chronic conditions (orthopedic condition, rheumatism, asthma, COPD, cancer) in the heiQ™ with N = 1404 rehabilitation inpatients. Impact on latent and composite mean differences was examined. Results (1) A total of 30 relevant studies suggested that about one in three items lacked MI. However, only four studies examined impact on latent mean differences. Scale means were only affected in one of these three studies. (2) Across the eight heiQ™ scales, seven scales had items with lack of MI in at least one disease group. However, in only two heiQ™ scales were some latent or composite mean differences affected.

The measurement properties referring to content, structural and cross-cultural validity of the VISA questionnaires were appraised and synthesized. Methods: The systematic review was conducted according to Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) methodology. PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, SportsDiscus, grey literature, and reference lists were searched. Development studies and cross-cultural adaptations (12 languages) assessing content or structural validity of the VISA questionnaires were included and two reviewers assessed their methodological quality. Evidence for content (relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility), structural, and cross-cultural validity was synthesized. A modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to evidence synthesis. Results: The VISA-A presented very-low-quality evidence of sufficient relevance, insufficient comprehensiveness, and inconsistent comprehensibility. VISA-G displayed moderate-quality evidence for sufficient comprehensibility and very-low-quality evidence of sufficient relevance and comprehensiveness. The VISA-P presented very-low-quality evidence of sufficient relevance, insufficient comprehensiveness, and inconsistent comprehensibility, while VISA-H presented very-low evidence of insufficient content validity. VISA-A displayed low-quality evidence for structural validity concerning unidimensionality and internal structure, while VISA-H presented low-quality evidence of insufficient unidimensionality. The structural validity of VISA-G and VISA-P were indeterminate and inconsistent, respectively. Internal consistency for VISA-G, VISA-H, and VISA-P was indeterminate.

Meta-analytic analysis of invariance across samples: Introducing a method that does not require raw data,"af Wåhlberg, A. E.; Madison, Guy; Aasa, Ulrika; Yu, Jeong Jin","Invariance of surveys across different groups means that the respondents interpret the items in the same way, as reflected in similar factor loadings, for example. Invariance can be assessed using various statistical procedures, such as Multi-Group Confirmatory Factor Analysis. However, these analyses require access to raw data. Here, we introduce a meta-analytic method that requires only the factor correlation matrices of samples as input. It compares the structures of intercorrelations of factors by correlating these values across two samples, yielding a value of overall similarity for how the factors intercorrelate in different samples. This method was tested in three different ways. We conclude that the method yields useful results and can assess invariance when raw data are not available.

Differential Item Functioning Effect Size From the Multigroup Confirmatory Factor Analysis for a Meta-Analysis: A Simulation Study,"Park, Sung Eun; Ahn, Soyeon; Zopluoglu, Cengiz","This study presents a new approach to synthesizing differential item functioning (DIF) effect size: First, using correlation matrices from each study, we perform a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) that examines measurement invariance of a test item between two subgroups (i.e., focal and reference groups). Then we synthesize, across the studies, the differences in the estimated factor loadings between the two subgroups, resulting in a meta-analytic summary of the MGCFA effect sizes (MGCFA-ES). The performance of this new approach was examined using a Monte Carlo simulation, where we created 108 conditions by four factors: (1) three levels of item difficulty, (2) four magnitudes of DIF, (3) three levels of sample size, and (4) three types of correlation matrix (tetrachoric, adjusted Pearson, and Pearson). Results indicate that when MGCFA is fitted to tetrachoric correlation matrices, the meta-analytic summary of the MGCFA-ES performed best in terms of bias and mean square error values, 95% confidence interval coverages, empirical standard errors, Type I error rates, and statistical power; and reasonably well with adjusted Pearson correlation matrices. In addition, when tetrachoric correlation matrices are used, a meta-analytic summary of the MGCFA-ES performed well, particularly, under the condition that a high difficulty item with a large DIF was administered to a large sample size.

Exploring LGBT+ campus climate in the UK and Philippines: How prejudice and belonging shape inclusion in higher education,"Evangelista, Zyra M.; Lido, Catherine; Swingler, Maxine; Bohan, Jason","Although recent global developments suggest progress toward LGBT+ equality, institutional structures perpetuating differential treatment based on sexual orientation and gender identity persist. The present research employed a mixed-method campus climate study of LGBT+ and cis-heterosexual students sampled from Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in the Philippines and the UK. Phase 1 reports a large-scale survey assessing relationships among students’ social attitudes toward LGBT+, campus climate perceptions and experiences of harassment, well-being, academic persistence, and social identity belonging within the university (LGBT+ = 877; cis-heterosexual = 2107). Phase 2 reports focus groups and interviews with 35 LGBT+ students, further exploring their campus climate experiences. Triangulated results highlight the role of social identity belonging in creating positive LGBT+ campus climates. Fostering belonging, through visible institutional support for intersectional LGBT+ student organisations and endorsement of LGBT+ inclusive policies and programmes, is recommended for creating safe and inclusive spaces for LGBT+ students.",2022,,European Journal of Social Psychology,52,2,342-360,,10.1002/ejsp.2801,,#12414,Evangelista 2022,,,No
The influence of school climate and achievement on bullying: Comparative evidence from international large-scale assessment data,"Bokhove, Christian; Muijs, Daniel; Downey, Christopher","Background: Bullying is widely acknowledged as one of the most harmful events in a child’s life, leading to negative life experiences and outcomes. However, ‘school effects of bullying’ are rarely stu­ died from an international perspective, especially with international large-scale data.Purpose: In this study, we aim to look at bullying through an international comparative approach, focusing on the contribution of the school, the education system and culture, and pupil level factors such as socio-economic status (SES) and gender. Our key question is whether school factors can affect bullying prevalence.Methods: We used data from six countries (USA, Finland, England, Romania, Korea and Italy) from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), a large-scale international study. We used multilevel modelling to analyse the dataset. Findings: We find little evidence of a relation between country policies and levels of bullying, though there are differences in the extent to which school and pupil factors are related to bullying. The most consistent relationship was between gender and bullying, with prevalence higher among boys, while school factors were not significant.Conclusion: The findings indicate that ‘one size fits all’ school policies might not be the best course of action, and individual support might be a more fruitful avenue.",2022,,Educational Research,64,1,18-40,,10.1080/00131881.2021.1992294,,#12415,Bokhove 2022,,,Yes
The Effects of Social Rank and Neighborhood and School Environment on Adolescent Depression and Suicidal Ideation: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,"Vidal, Carol; Jun, Hyun-Jin; Latkin, Carl","Depression and suicide constitute major public health problems, and their prevalence has been increasing among adolescents in the United States. More research is needed to understand the association between multilevel risk factors and depression and suicidal ideation in adolescents, particularly factors related to perceived social rank and environmental stress. The present study examined relationships among family mental history of mental illness, in-utero and perinatal complications, social rank factors, environmental factors, and depression and suicidal ideation in the past month in a clinical population of adolescents. A cross-sectional survey was administered in outpatient clinics to 197 adolescents ages 12–18 who were primarily Black and female. Findings from structural equation modeling showed the largest effects for the social rank factor on depression and suicidal ideation in the past month. These findings highlight the importance of preventive interventions for coping with social hierarchies to prevent depression and suicidal ideation.",2022,,Child Psychiatry Hum Dev,,,,,10.1007/s10578-022-01347-2,,#12416,Vidal 2022,,,Yes
Teacher Victimization and Teacher Burnout: Multilevel Moderating Role of School Climate in a Large-scale Survey Study,"Yang, Chunyan; Chan, Mei-ki; Lin, Xueqin; Chen, Chun","Guided by the social-ecological model, the present study used hierarchical linear modeling to examine the multilevel associations between teacher victimization (TV), teacher burnout, and school climate. Participants were 1,711 teachers from 58 middle and high schools in mainland China. Using hierarchical linear modeling, the study found that upon controlling for teacher and school demographic factors, TV at the individual level had a significant and positive association with all three dimensions of teacher burnout (i.e., emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment). School climate at the teacher level, but not at the school level, was negatively associated with all three types of burnout. Moreover, school climate at the school level, but not at the teacher level, significantly moderated the association between TV and two dimensions of teacher burnout (i.e., depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment). More specifically, a positive school-level climate buffered the positive asso­ ciation between TV and depersonalization but magnified the positive asso­ ciation between TV and reduced personal accomplishment. The current findings highlight the importance of reducing teacher victimization and promoting a positive school climate for preventing teacher burnout and teacher retention. It also indicates that teacher’s adjustment in responding to teacher-targeted violence varies depending on school climate context and across the different dimensions of teacher burnout.",2022,,Journal of School Violence,21,2,206-221,,10.1080/15388220.2022.2041023,,#12417,Yang 2022,,,No
Risk and Protective Factors for Patterns of Bullying Involvement in Middle School Students,"Monopoli, W. John; Evans, Steven W.; Himawan, Lina K.","Research has identified at least three patterns of direct involvement in bullying and victimization: bullying, bullying-victimized, and predominantly victimized. However, little is known about risk and protective factors for these patterns. As such, the goals of the present study were to establish these patterns and examine risk and protective factors. Participants were 775 middle school students in grades 5–8. Latent profile analysis revealed three groups: a bullying-victimized group (5.2%), a predominantly victimized group (8.9%), and an uninvolved group (85.9%). Emotion dysregulation and beliefs in support of aggression conferred risk for membership in the bully­ ing-victimized group, whereas internalizing problems conferred risk for membership in the predominantly victimized group. One aspect of school culture – willingness to seek help – buffered risk for membership only in the bullying-victimized group. Given these differential patterns, researchers and practitioners may wish to further consider the utility of targeted interven­ tions and treatments.",2022,,Journal of School Violence,21,2,175-189,,10.1080/15388220.2022.2036171,,#12418,Monopoli 2022,,,Yes

"The Relationships between Childhood Bullying, School Connectedness, and Adolescent Adiposity, the Fragile Families Child and Wellbeing Study","Quader, Zerleen S.; Gazmararian, Julie A.; Suglia, Shakira F.","BACKGROUND School environments are important to consider for children's health. This study aims to determine if childhood peer bullying and school connectedness are associated with adolescent adiposity. METHODS A total of 3377 children from the age 9 child interview of the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study had self-reported bullying and school connectedness data at age 9, height and weight measured at ages 9 and 15, and waist circumference was measured during an age 15 home visit. Linear regression models estimated the association between bullying and school connectedness and (1) change in BMI between age 9 and 15, and (2) waist circumference at age 15. Models were stratified by sex. RESULTS Girls had larger increases in body mass index (BMI) when experiencing low school connectedness, and students that experienced both bullying and low school connectedness had larger increases in BMI. Girls had larger waist circumferences for increased levels of bullying, low connectedness, and experiencing both. CONCLUSIONS School environments may play a role in the development of increased adiposity and there may be gender differences in the types of factors that are important to consider, particularly for central adiposity. Positive and engaging school environments can help support students' development and healthy behaviors.",2022,,Journal of School Health,92,4,368-375,,10.1111/josh.13138,,#12420,Quader 2022,,,Yes
"Sense of belonging for college students with PTSD: the role of safety, stigma, and campus climate","Shalka, Tricia R.; Leal, Christina C.","Objective: This study explored differences in sense of belonging between students who identify as having PTSD and those who do not and then investigated the role of safety, stigma, and campus climate for mental health in this process. Participants: Participants included 162 undergraduates enrolled at United States institutions. Methods: Data were from the 2015–2016 Healthy Minds study. Analysis included an independent samples t-test and hierarchical regression models. Results: Results suggested that students with PTSD experienced less of a sense of belonging on their campus relative to students who do not have PTSD. Our model including safety, stigma, and campus climate explained 50% of the variance in predicting sense of belonging in the PTSD group. Conclusions: Results support the importance of clinicians, staff, and faculty helping students with PTSD to feel an increased sense of safety, reducing stigma for mental health, and improving campus climate for mental health on their campuses.",2022,,Journal of American College Health,70,3,698-705,,10.1080/07448481.2020.1762608,,#12421,Shalka 2022,,,Yes
Satisfaction with normative life domains and the course of anorexia nervosa,"van Doornik, Sanne F. W.; Ostafin, Brian D.; Jonker, Nienke C.; Glashouwer, Klaske A.; de Jong, Peter J.","Objective Satisfaction with normative life domains has been proposed as an important factor in the persistence of anorexia nervosa (AN). Initial evidence from a cross-sectional study indicated that individuals with AN reported lower satisfaction with normative life domains than individuals without an eating disorder. As an important next step in understanding causal relations, the present study used a longitudinal design to examine whether an improvement in AN symptoms is paralleled by an increase in satisfaction with normative life domains from baseline to follow-up and whether relatively low satisfaction with normative life domains at baseline is related to less improvement in AN symptoms. Methods During baseline and at 1-year follow-up, adolescents with AN (N = 69) completed the Brief Multidimensional Students' Life Satisfaction Scale to measure satisfaction with normative life domains (e.g., friendships, school experience). Furthermore, eating disorder symptoms and BMI were measured. Results Improvement in eating disorder symptoms, but not in BMI, was paralleled by an increase in satisfaction with normative life domains. Relatively low satisfaction with normative life domains at baseline was not prospectively related to less improvement in eating disorder symptoms or BMI at follow-up. Discussion Our findings provide initial evidence that satisfaction with normative life domains is a malleable factor which fluctuates with symptom severity in AN. The results of this exploratory study point to the relevance of examining whether targeting satisfactory engagement with specific life domains optimizes treatment effectiveness. Public Significance We explored whether an improvement in anorexia nervosa symptoms from start of treatment to 1-year follow-up would be paralleled by an increase in satisfaction with normative life domains. Improvement in eating disorder symptoms (but not BMI) was indeed related to a concurrent increase in satisfaction with normative life domains. These preliminary results point to the promising possibility that targeting satisfactory engagement with specific life domains may potentially enhance treatment effectiveness.",2022,,International Journal of Eating Disorders,55,4,553-563,,10.1002/eat.23691,,#12422,vanDoornik 2022,,,Yes
Revisiting the Intricate Interplay Between Aggression and Preadolescents' School Functioning: Longitudinal Predictions and Multilevel Latent Profiles,"Bardach, Lisa; Takuya Yanagida; Strohmeier, Dagmar","This work refined the complex associations between aggression (aggressive behavior and victimization) and school functioning in terms of school liking, interest, achievement, and social class climate. First, using longitudinal multilevel structural equation modeling, it was shown that aggressive behavior and victimization preceded lower school liking, achievement, and social class climate at the individual student level over 1 year (Sample 1: 665 Austrian preadolescents, 46.62% girls, first wave: Mage = 11.68 years, SD = 0.84). Second, the results from multilevel latent profile analysis revealed relations between aggression and school functioning profiles and allowed identifying distinct latent classes at the classroom level based on the relative frequency of these profiles (Sample 2: 1,639 Austrian preadolescents, 47.59% girls, Mage = 11.70 years, SD = 0.86). Aligned with cumulative risk perspectives, aggressor-victims belonged significantly more often to the least adaptive school functioning profile and the less adaptive latent class at the classroom level than uninvolved youth.",2022,,Developmental Psychology,58,4,714-729,,10.1037/dev0001317,,#12423,Bardach 2022,,,No
Intervention-enabled autonomy-supportive teaching improves the PE classroom climate to reduce antisocial behavior,"Cheon, Sung Hyeon; Reeve, Johnmarshall; Marsh, Herbert W.; Song, Yong-Gwan","BackgroundAutonomy-supportive teaching interventions enhance PE student outcomes. According to previous research, these benefits occur because autonomy-supportive teaching enhances students’ psychological needs, though they may also occur because such teaching enhances the classroom climate. The student benefit of interest was reduced classroom-wide antisocial behavior.ObjectivesWe predicted that teacher participation in the intervention would enhance both classroom climate and psychological needs assessed at the classroom level. We further predicted that improvements in the classroom climate would better explain decreased antisocial behavior.MethodUsing a cluster randomized control trial design with longitudinally-assessed dependent measures, we randomly assigned 49 physical education secondary-grade Korean teachers to participate (or not) in an autonomy-supportive teaching intervention (25 experimental, 24 control). The 1487 students in these 49 classrooms reported their individually-experienced need satisfaction and frustration and their classroom-level supportive climate, conflictual climate, and antisocial behavior across three waves.ResultsA series of doubly latent multilevel structural equation modeling analyses showed that, at the classroom level, (1) intervention-enabled autonomy-supportive teaching improved both students’ psychological needs (more satisfaction, β = 0.84; less frustration, β = −0.66) and the prevailing classroom climate (more supportive, β = 0.77; less conflictual, β = −0.68) and (2) the improved climate best explained why antisocial behavior declined (overall R2 = 0.86).ConclusionThese findings show the importance of incorporating classroom climate effects to understand why autonomy-supportive teaching interventions improve student outcomes.",2022,,Psychology of Sport and Exercise,60,,102174,,10.1016/j.psychsport.2022.102174,,#12424,Cheon 2022,,,Yes
Examining the Effectiveness of the WITS Programs in the Context of Variability in Trajectories of Child Development,"Leadbeater, Bonnie; Sukhawathanakul, Paweena; Rush, Jonathan; Merrin, Gabriel; Lewis, Nathan","This study has two objectives: (1) to report the results of a large-scale, longitudinal evaluation of the WITS Programs that included a large sample of elementary school children (n = 1967) from 27 rural schools (including 16 program schools) and (2) to examine and discuss the effects of average developmental trajectories and of heterogeneity in children’s development on intervention outcomes. Data comprise baseline (spring) and four follow-up assessments (5 Waves) from children (N = 1967) and their parents and teachers. WITS stands for Walk away Ignore, Talk it out, and Seek Help (www.witsprograms.com). The children in the intervention schools declined more slowly than those in the control schools in their reports of relational victimization. Children in the intervention schools also declined faster in aggression and emotional problems relative to children in control schools. Moderation analyses showed that intervention group children with higher baseline levels of emotional problems declined faster in emotional problems than those with lower problems at baseline. In addition, children in grades 3 and over completed school climate questionnaire and children in control schools who had more negative perceptions of school climate at baseline showed greater increases in these negative perceptions compared to children in the intervention schools. We discuss the potential impact of average trajectories of child development and the within-child heterogeneity in assessments for the interpretation of the findings. We also conclude by highlighting evaluation design modifications that may improve our future ability to examine the effects of preventive interventions for elementary school children.",2022,,Prev Sci,23,4,538-551,,10.1007/s11121-021-01327-3,,#12425,Leadbeater 2022,,,Yes

Results showed significant and consistent associations between teachers’ percep­ tions of students’ social behaviours and adolescents’ self-perceptions of behavioural conduct. Positive correlations were found between teachers’ ratings of prosocial behaviours and gender-feminine orientation, and between teachers’ ratings of aggression and gender-masculine orienta­ tion. Gender differences were found as teachers scored girls higher in prosocial behaviours and boys higher in relational and physical aggres­ sion.

Engagement norms buffer academic risks associated with peer rejection in middle school,"Lessard, Leah M.; Juvonen, Jaana","The current study examined school variations in academic engagement norms and whether such norms affect those most susceptible to peer influence. We presumed that behaviors associated with perceived popularity make norms salient and are most likely to affect socially marginalized (rejected) youth. Focusing on differences across 26 middle schools, the main aim was to test whether academic engagement norms moderate the association between peer rejection and subsequent academic difficulties. The U.S. public school sample included 5,991 youth (52% girls): 32% Latino/a, 20% White, 14% East/Southeast Asian, 12% African American, and 22% from other specific ethnic groups. Multilevel models were used to examine whether engagement norms moderated the association between sixth-grade peer rejection and changes in grade point average (GPA) and academic engagement across middle school (i.e., from sixth to eighth grade). Consistent with our contextual moderator hypothesis, the association between peer rejection and academic engagement was attenuated?and in the case of GPA eliminated?in schools where higher engagement was a salient norm. The study findings suggest that the behaviors of popular peers affect those on social margins and that academic difficulties are not inevitable for rejected youth.",2022,,International Journal of Behavioral Development,46,3,200-207,,10.1177/0165025420915779,,#12428,Lessard 2022,,,Yes

M.","Purpose: We examined associations between academic grades and positive health behaviors, individually and collectively, among U.S. high school students. Design: Cross-sectional study design. Setting: Data were from the 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Response rates were 75% for schools, 81% for students, and 60% overall (n = 14,765 students). Subjects: Youth in grades 9th–12th. Measures: We focused on youth behaviors that can prevent or delay the onset of chronic health conditions. Seven dietary, 3 physical activity, 2 sedentary screen time, and 4 tobacco product use behaviors were assessed. Variables were dichotomized (0/1) to indicate that a score was given to the positive health behavior response (e.g.,, did not smoke cigarettes = 1). A composite score was created by summing each positive health behavior response among 16 total health behaviors. Analysis: Multivariable logistic regression analyses for each individual health behavior, and a multivariable negative binomial regression for the composite score, were conducted with self-reported academic grades, controlling for sex, grade in school, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI) categories. Results: Controlling for covariates, students who reported mostly A's had 2.0 (P <.001) more positive health behaviors; students who reported mostly B's had 1.3 (P <.001) more positive health behaviors; and students who reported mostly C's had.78 (P <.001) more positive health behaviors, compared to students who reported mostly D's/F's.

Participants were 218 veteran parents of children in K-12 schools, who completed the Chicago Veterans Survey, including measures of PTSD and depression, unemployment, a school safety scale drawn from the California School Parent Survey, and an adverse child functioning screening tool. Regression models suggest that depression symptomatology and perceptions of less safe school climate were significantly associated with adverse outcomes among veteran-connected students. Safe school climate buffered against the negative effects of parents? depression symptoms, particularly at lower levels of depression severity.

However, no studies have simultaneously examined these two environmental supports in re]ation to children's eariy language skills and later literacy skills across elementary school. The current study examined how multiple years of early maternal language input from 6 to 36 months and later classroom instructional quality from pre-kindergarten (pre-K) through fifth grade were related to children's early language at 36 months and later literacy trajectories in word recognition and reading comprehension across elementary school. The study included a diverse, population-representative sample of 1,292 children who were born in low-wealth rural communities and followed through fifth grade. Video recordings and subsequent transcripts of mother-child shared picture book tasks in the home at four timepoints during early childhood were used to assess maternal diversity of vocabulary, utterance complexity. and engagement (wh-questions) during book sharing, The quality of instruction in elementary school was assessed using classroom observations from pre-K through fifth grade. Maternal complexity and engagement were indirectly related to children's literacy trajectories across pre-K to fifth grade through effects on early child language at 36 months. Higher-quality classroom instruction was not reliably related to concurrent literacy skills in pre-K through fifth grade.

Test–retest and interrater reliability were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Internal consistency was assessed with Cronbach’s alpha. Concurrent and convergent validity were explored via correlations with the PEM-CY. Further psychometrics were examined using a Rasch model. Results One hundred and eighty-seven children (136 [72.7%] male; mean age 9y [range 5y 6mo–12y 10mo, SD 2y]) were assessed by 67 teachers. Cronbach’s alpha, test–retest, and interrater reliability were acceptable–excellent across each SPQ scale (alphas=0.89, 0.9, 0.94, 0.79; test–retest ICCs=0.64, 0.61, 0.78, 0.62; interrater ICCs=0.85, 0.71, 0.90, 0.81). Concurrent and convergent validity were confirmed with significant positive correlations between SPQ and PEM-CY. After Mokken and Rasch model analysis, person and item reliability were good, and unidimensionality was confirmed. Mean administration time was 8.2 minutes. Interpretation The results suggest that the SPQ is a rapid, reliable, and valid tool for assessment of participation-related indicators in schools.",2022,,Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology,64,7,847-854,,10.1111/dmcn.15146,,#12436,Maciver 2022,,,Yes
"Students’ growth mindset: Relation to teacher beliefs, teaching practices, and school climate","Yu, Junlin; Kreijkes, Pia; Salmela-Aro, Katariina","To effectively cultivate students' growth mindset, it is important to identify contextual factors that may communicate mindset messages to students. The present study examined the association of students' growth mindset with various dimensions of teacher beliefs (mindset, self-efficacy), teaching practices (guided inquiry, group work, task differentiation, in-class ability grouping, mastery and normative evaluations), and school climate (holistic development, in-school ability grouping). Participants were 2200 ten-year-old students, 358 teachers, and 65 principals from Finnish elementary schools that participated in the OECD Survey on Social and Emotional Skills. Multilevel analyses show that students endorsed more of a growth mindset in classrooms where teachers used guided inquiry and in schools that emphasized students' social-emotional development. In contrast, students endorsed more of a fixed mindset when teachers assigned different tasks to different students based on ability. Implications for how to combine teaching practices to support students’ growth mindset are discussed.",2022,,Learning and Instruction,80,,101616,,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2022.101616,,#12437,Yu 2022,,,Yes
"Predictors of bullying, depression, and suicide attempts among youth: The intersection of race/ethnicity by gender identity","Park, In Young; Speer, Rachel; Whitfield, Darren L.; Kattari, Leo; Walls, Eugene N.; Christensen, Candace","Using multivariate logistic regression, the current study analyzes data from the 2015 Healthy Kids Colorado Survey – a representative sample of 7,095 public high school students between the ages of 14 and 18 in Colorado – to explore the relationship between the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender identity with mental and behavioral health-related risks including depression, school bullying, online bullying, and suicidal ideation. As anticipated, we find that some health-related risks were higher among youth with multiple marginalized identities. Specifically, youth identifying both as Bi/Multi-racial or Latino and as transgender/non-binary had significantly higher levels of depression and suicidal ideation compared to cisgender White youth. Risk prevention and response interventions should use intersectional approaches responsive to the unique needs of racial/ethnic minority youth who are also transgender/non-binary.",2022,,Children and Youth Services Review,139,,106536,,10.1016/j.childyouth.2022.106536,,#12438,Park 2022,,,Yes
Assumptions of Cross-Level Measurement and Structural Invariance in the Analysis of Multilevel Data: Problems and Solutions,"Zyphur, Michael J.; Kaplan, Seth A.; Christian, Michael S.","This article demonstrates assumptions of invariance that researchers often implicitly make when analyzing multilevel data. The first set of assumptions is measurement-based and corresponds to the fact that researchers often conduct single-level exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and reliability analyses, with multilevel data. The second assumption, that of structural invariance, is engineered into the common multilevel random coefficient model, in that such analyses impose structural invariance across multiple levels of analysis when lower-level relationships represent both between- and within-groups effects. The nature of these assumptions, and ways to address their tenability, are explored from a conceptual standpoint. Then an empirical example of these assumptions and ways to address them is provided.",2008,,Group Dynamics,12,2,127-140,,10.1037/1089-2699.12.2.127,,#12439,Zyphur 2008,,,No

Assessing Measurement Invariance Across Multiple Groups: When Is Fit Good Enough?,"van Dijk, Wilhelmina; Schatschneider, Christopher; Al Otaiba, Stephanie; Hart, Sara A.","Complex research questions often need large samples to obtain accurate estimates of parameters and adequate power. Combining extant data sets into a large, pooled data set is one way this can be accomplished without expending resources. Measurement invariance (MI) modeling is an established approach to ensure participant scores are on the same scale. There are two major problems when combining independent data sets through MI. First, sample sizes will often be large leading to small differences becoming noninvariant. Second, not all data sets may include the same combination of measures. In this article, we present a method that can deal with both these problems and is user friendly. It is a combination of generating random normal deviates for variables missing completely in combination with assessing model fit using the root mean square error of approximation good enough principle, based on the hypothesis that the difference between groups is not zero but small. We demonstrate the method by examining MI across eight independent data sets and compare the MI decisions of the traditional and good enough approach. Our results show the approach has potential in combining educational data.",2022,,Educational and Psychological Measurement,82,3,482-505,,10.1177/00131644211023567,,#12444,vanDijk 2022,,,No
Getting better all the time? An illustrative investigation of multilevel longitudinal measurement invariance based on school climate surveys,"Schweig, Jonathan D.; Yuan, Kun","School climate surveys are central to school improvement and principal evaluation policies. The quality of school climate has been linked both to student achievement and to teacher retention. Oftentimes, policymakers and practitioners are concerned with monitoring change in school climate quality in each academic year. Such applications assume longitudinal factorial invariance—it is presupposed that the surveys are measuring the same things in the same metric at each time point. While there is considerable research examining the validity of inferences based on survey‐derived climate indicators, this research is almost exclusively based on cross‐sectional data. There is little literature describing procedures for gathering evidence of factorial invariance of school climate indicators. This study proposes to adapt existing methods for evaluating factorial invariance in longitudinal designs into multilevel frameworks, and in doing so, articulates a novel method for evaluating longitudinal measurement invariance in school climate research. This technique is illustrated on a widely used school climate survey.

Teacher perceptions matter: Psychometric properties of the Georgia School Personnel Survey of school climate,"Saint, Jo; Rice, Kenneth G.; Varjas, Kris; Meyers, Joel","There are many measures of student perceptions of school climate; accordingly, there is a staggering amount of research examining those perceptions and related outcomes. There is a comparatively small number of measures examining school personnel perceptions. Of those found, only some had evidence of measurement invariance/equivalence (MI/E). None found with evidence of MI/E had evidence of structural invariance/equivalence (SI/E). This article explores these psychometric properties of The Georgia School Personnel Survey (GSPS) of school climate. We analyzed a representative sample of Georgia school personnel (N = 166,887) through exploratory, confirmatory, and multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. Results indicated that the GSPS has a second-order model containing six first-order subscales loading onto a second-order scale (acting as a measure of whole-school climate). Assessment of MI/E and SI/E suggested that the GSPS is an appropriate measure for comparisons based on gender, racial/ethnic identity, grade level, and job classification. Implications for research and practice will be discussed referencing the Cultural-Ecological Model of School Climate (CEMSC).Impact statement This research provides psychometric properties for the Georgia School Personnel Survey (GSPS) of school climate, giving school personnel, lawmakers, and researchers information necessary to justify the use of the GSPS as a valid tool to assess and confidently compare staff perceptions of school climate. Specifically, this research provides evidence that the GSPS may be used to compare perceptions of school climate between school staff based on demographic characteristics (gender, racial/ethnic identity, job classification, and grade level). This research may be of special interest to a range of stakeholders, including school psychologists, district- and school-level administrators, and policymakers who are interested in comparing perceptions within schools or systems. School psychologists, who are trained as data-based decision-makers, play an important role as advocates to administrators and other school personnel. Specifically, school psychologists can help teams to analyze and interpret data as part of an empirically-based intervention to address the needs of school personnel.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/2372966X.2021.1958645 .",2021,,School Psychology Review,50,,406-419,,https://doi.org/10.1080/2372966X.2021.1958645,,#12446,Saint 2021,,,Yes
Cross-Level Group Measurement Invariance When Groups Are at Different Levels of Multilevel Data,"Kim, Eun Sook; Wang, Yan; Kiefer, Sarah M.","Studies comparing groups that are at different levels of multilevel data (namely, cross-level groups) using the same measure are not unusual such as student and teacher agreement in education or congruence between patient and physician perceptions in health research. Although establishing measurement invariance (MI) between these groups is important, testing MI is methodologically challenging because the groups compared for MI are at different levels with one group nested within the other group. We propose a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model that allows MI testing between cross-level groups at the between level and demonstrated testing MI between students and teachers using the promoting social interaction scale. Along with the demonstration, some methodological issues in implementing the proposed model (e.g., cluster invariance and reliability) and evaluating the model fit of multilevel CFA (e.g., ?CFI and level-specific fit indices) and alternative approaches to the proposed model are discussed.",2018,,Educational and Psychological Measurement,78,6,973-997,,10.1177/0013164417739062,,#12447,Kim 2018,,,Yes
The School Climate and Academic Mindset Inventory (SCAMI): Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Invariance Across Demographic Groups,"Kearney, Christopher A.; Sanmartín, Ricardo; Gonzálvez, Carolina","School climate is a multidimensional construct of the quality of a student’s academic environment, often subsuming dimensions such as safety, instructional practices, social relationships, school facilities, and school connectedness. Positive school climate has beneﬁcial effects on a wide range of adjustment variables in youth, including academic achievement, mental health, school attendance and graduation, and school-based behavior. Studies regarding school climate assessment have burgeoned in recent years but remain marked by limited sample sizes, narrow developmental levels, restricted items, unclear psychometric strength across multiple demographic groups, and lack of integration with key student education contextual factors such as academic mindset and social emotional learning. The present study evaluated a comprehensive measure of aspects of school climate, academic mindset, and social emotional learning in a sample of 105,379 diverse students (Mage = 13.47 years; SD = 2.47). The 9-factor structure of the School Climate and Academic Mindset Inventory was supported via conﬁrmatory factor analysis. A trimmed model displayed adequate goodness-of-ﬁt for males and females, younger age groups, and European American, biracial/multiracial, Hispanic, Native American, and Native Hawaiian/Paciﬁc Islander students. The trimmed model was slightly less strong for older age groups as well as for African American and Asian American students. The scale may be useful for assessing school climate interventions, longitudinal climate patterns, and school-based algorithms of future performance, though additional validation of the scale remains necessary.",2020,,Front.

Factorial Invariance of an Integrated Measure of Classroom Sense of Community in Face-to-Face and Online Courses.,"Cho, YoonJung; Hathcoat, John D.; Bridges, Stacey L.; Mathew, Susan; Bang, Hyeyoung","The aim of the present study was to develop a more integrated measure of classroom sense of community (SOC) while testing factorial invariance of the measurement structure across face-to-face and online courses. We incorporated two existing SOC measures to capture both context-specific and context-general characteristics of SOC and developed an integrated scale of classroom SOC with a four-factor structure. Tests of measurement invariance indicated that the new measure of classroom SOC has equivalent patterns of factor loadings, strength of factor loadings, and intercepts across the two course delivery modes, thus making this a viable measure to examine potential differences across these contexts. Latent mean analysis indicated that students in an online course perceived a lower level of SOC.

Association between school climate and bullying victimization: Advancing integrated perspectives from parents and cross-country comparisons,"Chen, Chun; Yang, Chunyan; Chan, Meiki; Jimerson, Shane R.","To advance our scientific understanding about school climate and bullying victimization from the perspectives of both parents and cross-country comparisons, the present study examined the cross-country similarities and differences of the associations between overall school climate and 3 forms of bullying victimization between United States (U.S.; N = 1,251) and Chinese (N = 999) parents across elementary, middle, and high schools. Confirmatory factor analyses and measurement invariance tests were first conducted to examine the cross-country validity of the Delaware Bullying Victimization Survey—Home (DBVS-H) between U.S. and Chinese parents. Comparison of latent means of bullying victimization revealed that U.S. parents reported higher frequencies of social/relational and verbal bullying victimization compared with Chinese parents. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was then used to examine the cross-country differences of the relationship between school climate and bullying victimization. For parents in both China and the U.S., school climate was found to be significantly associated with 3 types of bullying victimization (i.e., physical, verbal, and social/relational). The negative associations between school climate and all 3 types of bullying victimization reported by U.S. parents were significantly stronger than those found in Chinese parents. Implications for bullying prevention efforts involving parents from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds were discussed.

Differences in school climate and student engagement in China and the United States,"Bear, George G.; Yang, Chunyan; Chen, Dandan; He, Xianyou; Xie, Jia-Shu; Huang, Xishan","Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine differences between American and Chinese students in their perceptions of school climate and engagement in school, and in the relation between school climate and engagement. Method: Confirmatory factor analyses were used to support the factor structure and measurement invariance of the two measures administered: The Delaware School Climate Survey-Student and the Delaware Student Engagement Scale. Differences in latent means were tested, and differences in relations between variables were examined using multilevel hierarchical linear modeling. Participants consisted of 3,176 Chinese and 4,085 American students, Grades 3–5, 7–8, and 10–12. Results: Chinese students perceived school climate more favorably than American students, particularly beyond elementary school. Findings were more complex for student engagement. In elementary school, American students reported greater cognitive–behavioral and emotional engagement, and especially the former. In middle school and high school, Chinese students reported greater emotional engagement; however, no significant differences were found for cognitive–behavioral engagement. Most intriguing were results of multilevel hierarchical modeling that examined associations between school climate and student engagement: They were significant in American schools but not Chinese schools. Conclusion: Chinese students, compared with American students, perceived the climate of their schools more favorably, especially after elementary school. However, among Chinese students, their perceptions of school climate were unrelated to their self-reported engagement in school—school climate did not seem to matter as much.

Effects of Estimation Methods on Making Trait-Level Inferences From Ordered Categorical Items for Assessing Psychopathology,"Dumenci, Levent; Achenbach, Thomas M.","In assessments of attitudes, personality, and psychopathology, unidimensional scale scores are commonly obtained from Likert scale items to make inferences about individuals' trait levels. This study approached the issue of how best to combine Likert scale items to estimate test scores from the practitioner's perspective: Does it really matter which method is used to estimate a trait? Analyses of 3 data sets indicated that commonly used methods could be classified into 2 groups: methods that explicitly take account of the ordered categorical item distributions (i.e., partial credit and graded response models of item response theory, factor analysis using an asymptotically distribution-free estimator) and methods that do not distinguish Likert-type items from continuously distributed items (i.e., total score, principal component analysis, maximum-likelihood factor analysis). Differences in trait estimates were found to be trivial within each group. Yet the results suggested that inferences about individuals' trait levels differ considerably between the 2 groups. One should therefore choose a method that explicitly takes account of item distributions in estimating unidimensional traits from ordered categorical response formats. Consequences of violating distributional assumptions were discussed.",2008,,Psychological Assessment,20,2,55-62,,10.1037/1040-3590.20.1.55,,#12459,Dumenci 2008,,,No

This study examined the issue of covariate effects with FMM in the context of measurement invariance testing. Specifically, the impact of excluding and misspecifying covariate effects on measurement invariance testing and class enumeration was investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. Data were generated based on FMM models with (1) a zero covariate effect, (2) a covariate effect on the latent class variable, and (3) covariate effects on both the latent class variable and the factor. For each population model, different analysis models that excluded or misspecified covariate effects were fitted. Results highlighted the importance of including proper covariates in measurement invariance testing and evidenced the utility of a model comparison approach in searching for the correct specification of covariate effects and the level of measurement invariance. This approach was demonstrated using an empirical data set.

The aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date account of the theory and methodological developments underlying the applications of finite mixture models. Because of their flexibility, mixture models are being increasingly exploited as a convenient, semiparametric way in which to model unknown distributional shapes. This is in addition to their obvious applications where there is group-structure in the data or where the aim is to explore the data for such structure, as in a cluster analysis. It has now been three decades since the publication of the monograph by McLachlan & Basford (1988) with an emphasis on the potential usefulness of mixture models for inference and clustering. Since then, mixture models have attracted the interest of many researchers and have found many new and interesting fields of application. Thus, the literature on mixture models has expanded enormously, and as a consequence, the bibliography here can only provide selected coverage.",2019,,Annual Review of Statistics and Its Application,6,1,355-378,,10.1146/annurev-statistics-031017-100325,,#12471,McLachlan 2019,,,No
Growth mixture models: a case example of the longitudinal analysis of patient‐reported outcomes data captured by a clinical registry,"Kwon, Jae-Yung; Sawatzky, Richard; Baumbusch, Jennifer; Lauck, Sandra; Ratner, Pamela A.","Background: An assumption in many analyses of longitudinal patient-reported outcome (PRO) data is that there is a single population following a single health trajectory. One approach that may help researchers move beyond this traditional assumption, with its inherent limitations, is growth mixture modelling (GMM), which can identify and assess multiple unobserved trajectories of patients’ health outcomes. We describe the process that was undertaken for a GMM analysis of longitudinal PRO data captured by a clinical registry for outpatients with atrial fibrillation (AF).Methods: This expository paper describes the modelling approach and some methodological issues that require particular attention, including (a) determining the metric of time, (b) specifying the GMMs, and (c) including predictors of membership in the identified latent classes (groups or subtypes of patients with distinct trajectories). An example is provided of a longitudinal analysis of PRO data (patients’ responses to the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) Questionnaire) collected between 2008 and 2016 for a population-based cardiac registry and deterministically linked with administrative health data.Results: In determining the metric of time, multiple processes were required to ensure that “time” accounted for both the frequency and timing of the measurement occurrences in light of the variability in both the number of measures taken and the intervals between those measures. In specifying the GMM, convergence issues, a common problem that results in unreliable model estimates, required constrained parameter exploration techniques. For the identification of predictors of the latent classes, the 3-step (stepwise) approach was selected such that the addition of predictor variables did not change class membership itself.Conclusions: GMM can be a valuable tool for classifying multiple unique PRO trajectories that have previously been unobserved in real-world applications; however, their use requires substantial transparency regarding the processes underlying model building as they can directly affect the results and therefore their interpretation.",2021,,BMC Med Res Methodol,21,1,79,,10.1186/s12874-021-01276-z,,#12472,Kwon 2021,,,Yes

A constrained factor mixture analysis model for consistent and inconsistent respondents to mixed-worded scales.,"Steinmann, Isa; Strietholt, Rolf; Braeken, Johan","Mixed-worded scales require a more careful reading and answering process than scales with only one type of wording. The present study is about the unintended consequences of using such scales, because typically, not all respondents answer positively and negatively worded items consistently. This population heterogeneity—meaning that there are distinct groups of consistently and inconsistently answering respondents—may arguably underlie wording-related effects in mixed-worded scales. We formulated a constrained factor mixture analysis model that operationalized these two assumed classes of respondents. We investigated ﬁve data sets that contained four mixed-worded attitude scales, large-scale samples from three countries (Germany, Australia, and the U.S.), and two age groups (children and adolescents). The constrained factor mixture analysis model showed estimated parameter patterns in line with theoretical expectations and consistently outperformed its more traditional competitor, conﬁrmatory factor analysis with one global and one orthogonal method factor across all used data sets. We found proportions of between 7% and 20% of respondents belonging to the inconsistent classes. To further substantiate and validate the interpretation of the proposed model, we related class membership to theoretically relevant respondent characteristics such as reading achievement, cognitive skills, or conscientiousness. Further, we undertook an initial exploration of the overlap in inconsistent respondents’ class membership across time and across scales within a survey. The article discusses implications for future research as well as for the use of mixed-worded scales.",2022,,Psychological Methods,27,4,667-702,,10.1037/met0000392,,#12475,Steinmann 2022,,,No
Measurement Invariance Testing Across Between-Level Latent Classes Using Multilevel Factor Mixture Modeling,"Kim, Eun Sook; Joo, Seang-Hwane; Lee, Philseok; Wang, Yan; Stark, Stephen","This simulation study examines the efﬁcacy of multilevel factor mixture modeling (ML FMM) for measurement invariance testing across unobserved groups when the groups are at the between level of multilevel data. To this end, latent classes are generated with class-speciﬁc item parameters (i.e., factor loading and intercept) across the between-level classes. The efﬁcacy of ML FMM is evaluated in terms of class enumeration, class assignment, and the detection of noninvariance. Various classiﬁcation criteria such as Akaike’s information criterion, Bayesian information criterion, and bootstrap likelihood ratio tests are examined for the correct enumeration of betweenlevel latent classes. For the detection of measurement noninvariance, free and constrained baseline approaches are compared with respect to true positive and false positive rates. This study evidences the adequacy of ML FMM. However, its performance heavily depends on the simulation factors such as the classiﬁcation criteria, sample size, and the magnitude of noninvariance.

Models and Strategies for Factor Mixture Analysis: An Example Concerning the Structure Underlying Psychological Disorders,"Clark, Shaunna L.; Muthén, Bengt; Kaprio, Jaakko; D'Onofrio, Brian M.; Viken, Richard; Rose, Richard J.","The factor mixture model (FMM) uses a hybrid of both categorical and continuous latent variables. The FMM is a good model for the underlying structure of psychopathology because the use of both categorical and continuous latent variables allows the structure to be simultaneously categorical and dimensional. This is useful because both diagnostic class membership and the range of severity within and across diagnostic classes can be modeled concurrently. While the conceptualization of the FMM has been explained in the literature, the use of the FMM is still not prevalent. One reason is that there is little research about how such models should be applied in practice and, once a well fitting model is obtained, how it should be interpreted. In this paper, the FMM will be explored by studying a real data example on conduct disorder. By exploring this example, this paper aims to explain the different formulations of the FMM, the various steps in building a FMM, as well as how to decide between a FMM and alternative models.",2013,,Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal,20,4,681-703,,10.1080/10705511.2013.824786,,#12479,Clark 2013,,,No

Multiple Group Analysis in Multilevel Data Across Within-Level Groups: A Comparison of Multilevel Factor Mixture Modeling and Multilevel Multiple-Indicators Multiple-Causes Modeling,"Son, Sookyoung; Hong, Sehee","The purpose of this two-part study is to evaluate methods for multiple group analysis when the comparison group is at the within level with multilevel data, using a multilevel factor mixture model (ML FMM) and a multilevel multiple-indicators multiple-causes (ML MIMIC) model. The performance of these methods was evaluated integrally by a series of procedures testing weak and strong invariance models and the latent group mean differences testing after holding for factorial invariance. Two Monte Carlo simulation studies were conducted under the following conditions: number of clusters, cluster size, and the design type in groups. A multilevel one-factor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model as a research model in Study 1 was investigated to compare the results under different conditions with those of previous studies. A multilevel two-factor CFA model as a research model in Study 2 was evaluated by fitting alternative models that can be applied when the model is complicated. The results indicated that the two methods were reasonable in multilevel multiple groups analysis across within-level groups. However, pros and cons were found between the two methods. In the multilevel one-factor CFA model, ML MIMIC model was slightly better when the sample size is small. In the multilevel complex model, two alternative models of ML FMM were recommended because the weak invariance testing of ML MIMIC was considerably time-consuming. Finally, it was shown that information criteria, which are criteria for determining whether factorial invariance is established, need to be applied differently according to the sample size conditions. Guidelines for this situation are provided.",2021,,Educational and Psychological Measurement,81,5,904-935,,10.1177/0013164420987899,,#12483,Son 2021,,,Yes

Additionally, the performance of different types of model selection criteria for determining factorial invariance or detecting item noninvariance was examined.

Measurement Bias in Multilevel Data,"Jak, Suzanne; Oort, Frans J.; Dolan, Conor V.","Measurement bias can be detected using structural equation modeling (SEM), by testing measurement invariance with multigroup factor analysis (Jöreskog, 1971; Meredith, 1993; Sörbom, 1974), MIMIC modeling (Muthén, 1989), or restricted factor analysis (Oort, 1992, 1998). In educational research, data often have a nested, multilevel structure, for example when data are collected from children in classrooms. Multilevel structures might complicate measurement bias research. In 2-level data, the potentially “biasing trait” or “violator” can be a Level 1 variable (e.g., pupil sex), or a Level 2 variable (e.g., teacher sex). One can also test measurement invariance with respect to the clustering variable (e.g., classroom). This article provides a stepwise approach for the detection of measurement bias with respect to these 3 types of violators. This approach works from Level 1 upward, so the ﬁnal model accounts for all bias and substantive ﬁndings at both levels.

Rieke, 1994). The authors’ results indicate that ideal point models can provide as good or better fit to personality items than do dominance models because they can fit monotonically increasing item response functions but do not require this property.

"Measurement Equivalence of Ordinal Items: A Comparison of Factor Analytic, Item Response Theory, and Latent Class Approaches","Kankaraš, Miloš; Vermunt, Jeroen K.; Moors, Guy","Three distinctive methods of assessing measurement equivalence of ordinal items, namely, confirmatory factor analysis, differential item functioning using item response theory, and latent class factor analysis, make different modeling assumptions and adopt different procedures. Simulation data are used to compare the performance of these three approaches in detecting the sources of measurement inequivalence. For this purpose, the authors simulated Likert-type data using two nonlinear models, one with categorical and one with continuous latent variables. Inequivalence was set up in the slope parameters (loadings) as well as in the item intercept parameters in a form resembling agreement and extreme response styles. Results indicate that the item response theory and latent class factor models can relatively accurately detect and locate inequivalence in the intercept and slope parameters both at the scale and the item levels. Confirmatory factor analysis performs well when inequivalence is located in the slope parameters but wrongfully indicates inequivalence in the slope parameters when inequivalence is located in the intercept parameters. Influences of sample size, number of inequivalent items in a scale, and model fit criteria on the performance of the three methods are also analyzed.",2011,,Sociological Methods & Research,40,2,279-310,,10.1177/0049124111405301,,#12490,Kankaraš 2011,,,No
A Modified Comparative Fit Index for Factorial Invariance Studies,"Lai, Mark H. C.; Yoon, Myeongsun","As a prerequisite for meaningful comparison of latent variables across multiple populations, measurement invariance or speciﬁcally factorial invariance has often been evaluated in social science research. Alongside with the changes in the model chi-square values, the comparative ﬁt index (CFI; Bentler, 1990) is a widely used ﬁt index for evaluating different stages of factorial invariance, including metric invariance (equal factor loadings), scalar invariance (equal intercepts), and strict invariance (equal unique factor variances). Although previous literature generally showed that the CFI performed well for single-group structural equation modeling analyses, its applicability to multiple group analyses such as factorial invariance studies has not been examined. In this study we argue that the commonly used default baseline model for the CFI might not be suitable for factorial invariance studies because (a) it is not nested within the scalar invariance model, and thus (b) the resulting CFI values might not be sensitive to the group differences in the measurement model. We therefore proposed a modiﬁed version of the CFI with an alternative (and less restrictive) baseline model that allows observed variables to be correlated. Monte Carlo simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the utility of this modiﬁed CFI across various conditions including varying degree of noninvariance and different factorial invariance models. Results showed that the modiﬁed CFI outperformed both the conventional CFI and the CFI (Cheung & Rensvold, 2002) in terms of sensitivity to small and medium noninvariance.",2015,,Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal,22,2,236-248,,10.1080/10705511.2014.935928,,#12491,Lai 2015,,,No

This kind of data complicate the evaluation of reliability and measurement invariance, because several properties can be evaluated at both the individual level and the cluster level, as well as across levels. For example, cross-level invariance implies equal factor loadings across levels, which is needed to give latent variables at the two levels a similar interpretation. Reliability at a speciﬁc level refers to the ratio of true score variance over total variance at that level. This paper aims to shine light on the relation between reliability, cross-level invariance, and strong factorial invariance across clusters in multilevel data. Speciﬁcally, we will illustrate how strong factorial invariance across clusters implies cross-level invariance and perfect reliability at the between level in multilevel factor models.",2017,,Front.

The adapted checklist was pilot-tested to strengthen content validity in a systematic review on the quality of PROMs for patients with hand osteoarthritis.Results  Most important changes were the reordering of the measurement properties to be assessed in a systematic review of PROMs; the deletion of standards that concerned reporting issues and standards that not necessarily lead to biased results; the integration of standards on general requirements for studies on item response theory with standards for specific measurement properties; the recommendation to the review team to specify hypotheses for construct validity and responsiveness in advance, and subsequently the removal of the standards about formulating hypotheses; and the change in the labels of the four-point rating system.Conclusions  The COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist was developed exclusively for use in systematic reviews of PROMs to distinguish this application from other purposes of assessing the methodological quality of studies on measurement properties, such as guidance for designing or reporting a study on the measurement properties.",2018,,Qual Life Res,27,5,1171-1179,,10.1007/s11136-017-1765-4,,#12501,Mokkink 2018,,,No

Second, what overlap in studies of student-reported school climate measures exist with the model dimensions?

A Review and Analysis of Selected School Climate Measures,"Olsen, Jacob; Preston, Angela I.; Algozzine, Bob; Algozzine, Kate; Cusumano, Dale","Although it is widely agreed that there is no universally accepted definition for school climate, most professionals ground it in shared beliefs, values, and attitudes reflecting the quality and character of life in schools. In this article, we review and analyze measures accessible to school personnel charged with documenting and monitoring school climate. We document core features of four scientifically sound and comprehensive measures of school climate. We believe our work serves as a selective consumer’s guide for school personnel engaged in important levels of decision-making related to monitoring and improving the quality and character of interactions that represent academic and behavior standards in schools.",2018,,"The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas",91,2,47-58,,10.1080/00098655.2017.1385999,,#12508,Olsen 2018,,,Yes
School climate multidimensionality and measurement: a systematic literature review,"Grazia, Valentina; Molinari, Luisa","School climate refers to individual perceptions of moral, relational and institutional aspects of school life. A growing body of research has conﬁrmed the importance of studying school climate for developing interventions able to reduce problem behaviours and to promote student and teacher wellbeing. However, the literature shows that research in the ﬁeld meets some challenges, as it is diﬃcult to empirically capture the nature of such a complex and broad construct. In the current work, we build on the results of previous reviews for addressing in particular two main concerns of researchers, namely school climate multidimensionality and measurement. In particular, we present an overview of empirical research carried out from 2010 and on, with the aim of speciﬁcally addressing three issues. First, to describe which measures were actually used in the empirical studies. Second, to explore whether Wang and Degol’s (2016) eﬀort to establish a common multidimensional ground was echoed by authors researching in the ﬁeld. Third, to account for studies that were based on multiple informants and longitudinal data.

The measurement invariance of university student ratings of instruction,"Berberoğlu, Giray; Kalender, İlker","The invariance in the scores of student rating of instruction was studied across high and low achieving classrooms. Achievement levels were determined by the two criteria such as self-reported expected grades and end of semester grades. The data included 625 classrooms. The equality of (i) factorial structure, (ii) factor loadings, (iii) item intercepts, and (iv) error variances of the 7 item rating scale were studied across these groups. With respect to self-reported expected grades, high and low achieving classes produced invariant scale characteristics except strict invariance. On the other hand, with respect to end of semester grades, full equality in item intercepts and error variances were not achieved. It seems that comparing the rating results across the classrooms and courses independent of the achievement levels of the students may be misleading especially for the high-stake decisions since the origin of the scale is not the same across high and low achieving groups.",2018,,HUJE,,,16-Jan,,10.16986/HUJE.2018045408,,#12510,Berberoğlu 2018,,,No

A New Instrument for Assessing Cohesion in Primary and Grammar School Classes—Factorial Structure and Measurement Invariance of the GruKo4,"Schürer, Sina; van Ophuysen, Stefanie; Behrmann, Lars","Class climate has been focused in the context of school research for decades. One central facet of class climate is cohesion. Whereas there are well-elaborated instruments to assess cohesion in different contexts (e.g., sport and therapy), such an instrument is missing for the school context. The aim of the current article is to present an instrument to measure different facets of group cohesion in classes of primary and grammar schools. The factorial structure of the instrument is analyzed using data from Grades 2 to 7 (N ≈ 3052 from 146 classes) by means of conﬁrmatory factor analysis. Furthermore, tests of measurement invariance across the different levels of education (primary vs. grammar school) are undertaken. Results support conﬁgural as well as partial metric and scalar invariance between students of primary and grammar schools. Further, cohesion in primary schools is signiﬁcantly higher than in grammar schools.

This review article provides an overview and appraisal of school climate measures published between 2003 and 2013 in scientific journals. A search for published school climate instruments for secondary school students was made in three databases. Twelve articles meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and included. Each measure is described in terms of contents, and psychometric and formal quality criteria. Most of the reviewed measures showed good or acceptable results in reliability analyses but insufficient validity testing. Theory-grounding for measurement development is often missing. All instruments include items addressing the relationship among students and between students and teachers while the environmental-structural area is considered the least. This review provides a compact overview of recently published studies using school climate instruments that have also been tested psychometrically.

Measuring school climate: an overview of measurement scales,"Kohl, Diane; Recchia, Sophie; Steffgen, Georges","Background: School climate is a heterogeneous concept with a multitude of standardised and validated instruments available to measure it.Purpose: This overview of measurement scales aims to provide researchers with short summaries of some of the self-report instruments in existence, especially in relation to the link between school climate and aggression, within the context of Bronfenbrenner’s model. A secondary aim of this article is to show how the same instrument can sometimes be adapted to ﬁt different theoretical approaches or to focus on different dimensions of school climate. Design and methods: After database consultation and literature hand searching, the resulting literature was screened for a statistical analysis of school climate and aggression. Those studies that had unclear operationalisations of the main variables or used qualitative methods were excluded. The resulting selection of studies were further scanned for common instruments used to evaluate school climate.Conclusions: This article will show how the California School Climate Survey (CSCS), the Psychological Sense of School Membership Scale (PSSM), the School Climate Survey (SCS) and the Effective School Battery (ESB) as well as different versions of self-created scales on school connectedness, school climate and school culture have been adapted by different researchers in different contexts.

A review of the relationship between parental involvement indicators and academic achievement,"Boonk, Lisa; Gijselaers, Hieronymus J.M.; Ritzen, Henk; Brand-Gruwel, Saskia","This paper reviews the research literature on the relationship between parental involvement and students' academic achievement with 75 studies published between 2003 and 2017. The results ﬁrst present how individual parental involvement variables correlate with academic achievement based on an age-related classiﬁcation. Then we move to a more profound review of the literature to determine which variables are moderating or mediating the relationship between parental involvement and academic achievement. Finally, we describe the advancements that were made with studies from the last decade with special focus on the construct of parental involvement. Parental involvement variables that show promises according to their correlations with academic achievement are: (a) reading at home, (b) parents that are holding high expectations/aspirations for their children's academic achievement and schooling, (c) communication between parents and children regarding school, (d) parental encouragement and support for learning.",2018,,Educational Research Review,24,,30-Oct,,10.1016/j.edurev.2018.02.001,,#12517,Boonk 2018,,,No

Can a school climate survey accurately and equitably measure school quality? Examining the multilevel structure and invariance of the Georgia School Climate Scale,"Zabek, Faith; Meyer, Joel; Rice, Ken; Ashby; Krueger, A. C.","School climate measures are increasingly utilized as one indicator of school quality within educational accountability systems. However, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of these indicators given that school climate surveys are often not validated using multilevel methods. Further, cross-school comparisons in climate may not be trustworthy because the school-level invariance of climate surveys has not been investigated. There is a need to examine the validity of school-level climate constructs and to determine if surveys measure climate equitably for schools that serve underrepresented populations. The aim of the current study was to examine the multilevel factor structure of a statewide school climate survey to determine whether it measured climate equitably for students of different races/ethnicities and across schools with varying racial/ethnic and socioeconomic compositions. Participants included 259,778 students from 427 middle schools throughout a southeastern U.S. state. Cross-level invariance analyses revealed that the climate constructs were measured differently across levels of analysis, and school-level climate could not be interpreted as merely the aggregate of individual-level climate. Student- and school-level factorial invariance was tested using multilevel modeling procedures. Results revealed item bias with respect to student and school characteris­ tics, and the relationships between school climate and student and school demographics changed after accounting for identified bias. As more educational agencies consider including school climate surveys in their accountability systems, these findings suggest that multilevel validation procedures and school-level invariance analyses are necessary to ensure accurate and equitable measurement.",2022,,Journal of School Psychology,,,24,,,,#12523,Zabek 2022,,,No

A bifactor method (defining a method factor for negatively worded items) did not show a good fit either. However, when items were combined per target to be rated (school, student, teacher, other people, and self), measurement invariance of a one-factorial model was found. Internal consistencies observed across the cultural groups studied were high. In addition, an evaluation of functional equivalence indicated that the relationship between PSSM and life satisfaction was invariant across countries.

Finding Clusters of Groups with Measurement Invariance: Unraveling Intercept Non-Invariance with Mixture Multigroup Factor Analysis,"De Roover, Kim","Comparisons of latent constructs across groups are ubiquitous in behavioral research and, nowadays, often numerous groups are involved. Measurement invariance of the constructs across the groups is imperative for valid comparisons and can be tested by multigroup factor analysis. Metric invariance (invariant factor loadings) often holds, whereas scalar invariance (invariant intercepts) is rarely supported across many groups. Scalar invariance is a prerequisite for comparing latent means, however. One may inspect group-specific intercepts to pinpoint non-invariances, but this is a daunting task in case of many groups. This paper presents mixture multigroup factor analysis (MMG-FA) for clustering groups based on their intercepts. Clusters of groups with scalar invariance are obtained by imposing cluster-specific intercepts and invariant loadings whereas unique variances, factor means, and factor (co)variances can differ between groups. Thus, MMG-FA ties down the number of intercepts to inspect and generates clusters of groups wherein latent means can be validly compared.",2021,,Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal,28,5,663-683,,10.1080/10705511.2020.1866577,,#12525,DeRoover 2021,,,Yes

A Monte Carlo study was conducted to investigate the efﬁcacy of the 5 methods in detecting measurement noninvariance across many groups using various ﬁt criteria. Generally, the 5 methods showed reasonable performance in identifying the level of invariance if an appropriate ﬁt criterion was used (e.g., Bayesian information criteron with multilevel factor mixture modeling).

Measurement Invariance for Latent Constructs in Multiple Populations: A Critical View and Refocus,"Raykov, Tenko; Marcoulides, George A.; Li, Cheng-Hsien","Popular measurement invariance testing procedures for latent constructs evaluated by multiple indicators in distinct populations are revisited and discussed. A frequently used test of factor loading invariance is shown to possess serious limitations that in general preclude it from accomplishing its goal of ascertaining this invariance. A process of mean intercept invariance evaluation is subsequently examined, and it is indicated that within this framework there is no statistical test available for group identity in them. Rather than pursuing these popular and widely used invariance testing procedures, it is recommended that empirical studies on constructs in multiple populations be concerned in general with alternative measurement invariance examination and ensuring the inclusion of their invariance conditions in models aimed at investigating group differences and similarities in latent means, variances, and interrelationships.

Rethinking fit assessment in structural equation modelling: A commentary and elaboration on Barrett (2007),"McIntosh, Cameron N.","With seemingly few exceptions, current practice in structural equation modelling (SEM) aims at establishing close rather than exact ﬁt between hypothetical models and observed data. This orientation has gone without serious challenge until the appearance of a sharp critique by Barrett (2007), who suggests discontinuing the use of approximate ﬁt indices (AFIs) in SEM. The present article provides a commentary and elaboration on the key aspects of Barrett’s position, and also supplies further practical guidance and methodological references to applied researchers, who may be motivated to signiﬁcantly alter their modelling practices in order to address the issues he raises. I strongly support his calls for performing more detailed diagnostic examinations of model misﬁt when confronted with a signiﬁcant chi-square (v2) test statistic, rather than simply deferring to AFIs. However, I do not second the recommendation that assessments of a model’s predictive accuracy (e.g., R2 values) can supplant a focused search for the reasons underlying signiﬁcant global misﬁt. Accordingly, some misconceptions about the relationship between global model ﬁt and predictive accuracy are pointed out, and modiﬁed advice is given to practitioners. Issues surrounding how to properly appraise a model yielding a non-signiﬁcant v2 are also discussed, as are concerns raised by Barrett about small sample size and power in SEM. It is concluded that AFIs oﬀer little value-added in SEM practice, given the wide variety of available methods for performing detailed model assessments. However, I leave the issue of whether AFIs should be completely abandoned to future research.",2007,,Personality and Individual Differences,42,5,859-867,,10.1016/j.paid.2006.09.020,,#12540,McIntosh 2007,,,Yes
Structural equation modelling: Adjudging model fit,"Barrett, Paul","For journal editors, reviewers, and readers of research articles, structural equation model (SEM) ﬁt has recently become a confusing and contentious area of evaluative methodology. Proponents of two kinds of approaches to model ﬁt can be identiﬁed: those who adhere strictly to the result from a null hypothesis signiﬁcance test, and those who ignore this and instead index model ﬁt as an approximation function. Both have principled reasons for their respective course of action. This paper argues that the chi-square exactﬁt test is the only substantive test of ﬁt for SEM, but, its sensitivity to discrepancies from expected values at increasing sample sizes can be highly problematic if those discrepancies are considered trivial from an explanatory-theory perspective. On the other hand, suitably scaled indices of approximate ﬁt do not possess this sensitivity to sample size, but neither are they ‘‘tests’’ of model ﬁt. The proposed solution to this dilemma is to consider the substantive ‘‘consequences’’ of accepting one explanatory model over another in terms of the predictive accuracy of theory-relevant-criteria.

Understanding the Comparative Fit Index: It's all about the base!,"van Laar, Saskia; Braeken, Johan","Despite the sensitivity of fit indices to various model and data characteristics in structural equation modeling, these fit indices are used in a rigid binary fashion as a mere rule of thumb threshold value in a search for model adequacy. Here, we address the behavior and interpretation of the popular Comparative Fit Index (CFI) by stressing that its metric for model assessment is the amount of misspecification in a baseline model and by further decomposition into its fundamental components: sample size, number of variables and the degree of multivariate dependence in the data. Simulation results show how these components influence the performance of CFI and its rule of thumb in practice. We discuss the usefulness of additional qualifications when applying the CFI rule of thumb and potential adjustments to its threshold value as a function of data characteristics. In conclusion, we at a minimum recommend a dual reporting strategy to provide the necessary context and base for meaningful interpretation and even more optimal, a move to using CFI as a real incremental fit index intended to evaluate the relative effect size of cumulative theoretically motivated model restrictions in terms of \% reduction in misspecification as measured by the baseline model.",2021,,,,,,,10.7275/23663996,,#12543,vanLaar 2021,,,No
The Effect of Estimation Methods on SEM Fit Indices,"Shi, Dexin; Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto","We examined the effect of estimation methods, maximum likelihood (ML), unweighted least squares (ULS), and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS), on three population SEM (structural equation modeling) fit indices: the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR). We considered different types and levels of misspecification in factor analysis models: misspecified dimensionality, omitting cross-loadings, and ignoring residual correlations. Estimation methods had substantial impacts on the RMSEA and CFI so that different cutoff values need to be employed for different estimators. In contrast, SRMR is robust to the method used to estimate the model parameters. The same criterion can be applied at the population level when using the SRMR to evaluate model fit, regardless of the choice of estimation method.",2020,,Educational and Psychological Measurement,80,3,421-445,,10.1177/0013164419885164,,#12544,Shi 2020,,,No
Evaluating the Fit of Structural Equation Models: Tests of Significance and Descriptive Goodness-of-Fit Measures,"Schermelleh-Engel, Karin; Moosbrugger, Helfried; Müller, Hans","For structural equation models, a huge variety of fit indices has been developed. These indices, however, can point to conflicting conclusions about the extent to which a model actually matches the observed data. The present article provides some guidelines that should help applied researchers to evaluate the adequacy of a given structural equation model. First, as goodness-of-fit measures depend on the method used for parameter estimation, maximum likelihood (ML) and weighted least squares (WLS) methods are introduced in the context of structural equation modeling. Then, the most common goodness-of-fit indices are discussed and some recommendations for practitioners given. Finally, we generated an artificial data set according to a ""true"" model and analyzed two misspecified and two correctly specified models as examples of poor model fit, adequate fit, and good fit.",2003,,,8,2,,,,,#12545,Schermelleh-Engel 2003,,,No
Assessing Cutoff Values of SEM Fit Indices: Advantages of the Unbiased SRMR Index and Its Cutoff Criterion Based on Communality,"Ximénez, Carmen; Maydeu-Olivares, Alberto; Shi, Dexin; Revuelta, Javier","Holding model misspecification constant, the behavior of fit indices depends on factors such as the number of variables being modeled (model size), and the average observed correlation (magnitude of factor loadings or measurement quality). We examine by simulation the interplay of these factors with sample size in CFA models. When a biased estimator of the fit index is used (CFI, TLI, or GFI), the behavior of the sample indices depends on sample size, rendering establishing cutoff values impossible. When an unbiased estimator is used (SRMR, or RMSEA) the behavior of the indices matches that of the population parameter and depends on the average R2 of the observed variables (communality); and for the RMSEA, also on model size. The use of the unbiased SRMR with a cutoff value adjusted by R2 is recommended as it enables assessing the degree of a model misspecification across model size, sample size, and measurement quality.",2022,,Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal,29,3,368-380,,10.1080/10705511.2021.1992596,,#12546,Ximénez 2022,,,Yes

“How Well Does Your Structural Equation Model Fit Your Data?”: Is Marcoulides and Yuan’s Equivalence Test the Answer?,"Peugh, James; Feldon, David F.","Structural equation modeling is an ideal data analytical tool for testing complex relationships among many analytical variables. It can simultaneously test multiple mediating and moderating relationships, estimate latent variables on the basis of related measures, and address practical issues such as nonnormality and missing data. To test the extent to which a hypothesized model provides an appropriate characterization of the collective relationships among its variables, researchers must assess the “fit” between the model and the sample’s data. However, interpreting estimates of model fit is a problematic process. The traditional inferential test of model fit, the chi-square test, is biased due to sample size. Fit indices provide descriptive (i.e., noninferential) values of model fit (e.g., comparative fit index, root-mean-square error of approximation), but are unable to provide a definitive “acceptable” or “unacceptable” fit determination. Marcoulides and Yuan have introduced an equivalence-testing technique for assessing model fit that combines traditional descriptive fit indices with an inferential testing strategy in the form of confidence intervals to facilitate more definitive fit conclusions. In this paper, we explain this technique and demonstrate its application, highlighting the substantial advantages it offers the life sciences education community for drawing robust conclusions from structural equation models. A structural equation model and data set (N = 1902) drawn from previously published research are used to illustrate how to perform and interpret an equivalence test of model fit using Marcoulides and Yuan’s approach.",2020,,LSE,19,3,es5,,10.1187/cbe.20-01-0016,,#12552,Peugh 2020,,,No

Using Fit Statistic Differences to Determine the Optimal Number of Factors to Retain in an Exploratory Factor Analysis,"Finch, W. Holmes","Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is widely used by researchers in the social sciences to characterize the latent structure underlying a set of observed indicator variables. One of the primary issues that must be resolved when conducting an EFA is determination of the number of factors to retain. There exist a large number of statistical tools designed to address this question, with none being universally optimal across applications. Recently, researchers have investigated the use of model fit indices that are commonly used in the conduct of confirmatory factor analysis to determine the number of factors to retain in EFA. These results have yielded mixed results, appearing to be effective when used in conjunction with normally distributed indicators, but not being as effective for categorical indicators. The purpose of this simulation study was to compare the performance of difference values for several fit indices as a method for identifying the optimal number of factors to retain in an EFA, with parallel analysis, which is one of the most reliable such extant methods. Results of the simulation demonstrated that the use of fit index difference values outperformed parallel analysis for categorical indicators, and for normally distributed indicators when factor loadings were small. Implications of these findings are discussed.",2020,,Educational and Psychological Measurement,80,2,217-241,,10.1177/0013164419865769,,#12554,Finch 2020,,,No
"RMSEA, CFI, and TLI in structural equation modeling with ordered categorical data: The story they tell depends on the estimation methods","Xia, Yan; Yang, Yanyun","In structural equation modeling, application of the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) highly relies on the conventional cutoff values developed under normal-theory maximum likelihood (ML) with continuous data. For ordered categorical data, unweighted least squares (ULS) and diagonally weighted least squares (DWLS) based on polychoric correlation matrices have been recommended in previous studies. Although no clear suggestions exist regarding the application of these fit indices when analyzing ordered categorical variables, practitioners are still tempted to adopt the conventional cutoff rules. The purpose of our research was to answer the question: Given a population polychoric correlation matrix and a hypothesized model, if ML results in a specific RMSEA value (e.g., .08), what is the RMSEA value when ULS or DWLS is applied? CFI and TLI were investigated in the same fashion. Both simulated and empirical polychoric correlation matrices with various degrees of model misspecification were employed to address the above question. The results showed that DWLS and ULS lead to smaller RMSEA and larger CFI and TLI values than does ML for all manipulated conditions, regardless of whether or not the indices are scaled. Applying the conventional cutoffs to DWLS and ULS, therefore, has a pronounced tendency not to discover model–data misfit.

Development of a dual school climate and school identification measure–student (SCASIM-St),"Lee, Eunro; Reynolds, Katherine J.; Subasic, Emina; Bromhead, Dave; Lin, Hanzhang; Marinov, Vladmir; Smithson, Michael","Extensive but separate bodies of research in education concern the constructs of school climate and school connectedness/belonging. In the interests of advancing a more integrated approach, a new measurement tool is developed– the School Climate and School Identiﬁcation Measure–Student (SCASIMSt). This scale builds on the Moos (1973) framework which assesses relationships, personal growth, and system management in schools. The social identity approach to group processes (Tajfel & Turner, 1979; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987) is used to extend work on school connectedness and belonging through the inclusion of a measure of social identiﬁcation. A range of methods across three studies are designed to assess the reliability and validity of SCASIM-St (N = 7209, Australian grades 7–10 students). These include conﬁrmatory factor analysis, test-retest analysis, and convergent validity (Study 1 and 2). Additionally measurement invariance tests for student sub-groups regarding gender, grade level, and non-English language, were employed in Study 3. It also included criterion validity analysis using multilevel models for the key outcome measures of students’ academic achievement, well-being, and aggressive behaviors.

The stability of elementary school contexts from kindergarten to third grade,"Lowenstein, Amy E.; Wolf, Sharon; Gershoff, Elizabeth T.; Sexton, Holly R.; Raver, C. Cybele; Aber, J. Lawrence","The nature and measurement of school contexts have been the foci of interest in community, developmental, and school psychology for decades. In this paper, we tested the stability of six elementary school-context factors over time, using a nationally representative and longitudinal sample of schools from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998–1999 (ECLS-K), and systems theories as a conceptual framework. Confirmatory factor analyses and tests of measurement equivalence revealed that six latent factors fit the data equally well across kindergarten, first grade, and third grade: school strain, school safety practices, school academic performance, school instructional resources, positive school climate, and school violence and crime. The factors were highly stable across the early elementary school years, with standardized stability coefficients ranging from .87 to .99 between kindergarten and first grade and from .71 to .98 between the first and third grades. Equivalence in the two sets of stability coefficients was also found across time. Both the magnitude and equivalence of the stability coefficients were robust to the inclusion of five key exogenous school characteristics as covariates in the model. Results suggest that elementary school contexts are remarkably stable over time and shed light on methodological considerations regarding the treatment of school-level measures in analyses that examine links between school context and children's academic and developmental trajectories.

Investigating population heterogeneity with factor mixture models,"Lubke, Gitta H.; Muthén, Bengt","Sources of population heterogeneity may or may not be observed. If the sources of heterogeneity are observed (e.g., gender), the sample can be split into groups and the data analyzed with methods for multiple groups. If the sources of population heterogeneity are unobserved, the data can be analyzed with latent class models. Factor mixture models are a combination of latent class and common factor models and can be used to explore unobserved population heterogeneity. Observed sources of heterogeneity can be included as covariates. The different ways to incorporate covariates correspond to different conceptual interpretations. These are discussed in detail. Characteristics of factor mixture modeling are described in comparison to other methods designed for data stemming from heterogeneous populations. A step-by-step analysis of a subset of data from the Longitudinal Survey of American Youth illustrates how factor mixture models can be applied in an exploratory fashion to data collected at a single time point.

From a multilevel perspective based on data from 21,579 students in 58 high schools, the present study assesses the multilevel factor structure of motivation and engagement with a particular focus on a recently developed instrument (the Motivation and Engagement Scale—High School; MES-HS) shown in a wide variety of contexts to reflect sound student-level psychometric properties. Multilevel (or hierarchical linear) confirmatory factor analysis using Mplus demonstrated that at student and school levels, the hypothesized framework comprised sound factor structure. Multilevel invariance tests further demonstrated that key parameters were invariant across student and school levels. Results also showed that first and higher order factor correlations were in hypothesized directions and broadly parallel at student and school levels. Taken together, the MES-HS target factors and the framework from which they emanate demonstrate sound multilevel psychometric properties.

An empirical examination of IRT information for school climate surveys,"Mo, Lun; Yang, Fang; Hu, Xiangen","School climate surveys are widely applied in school districts across the nation to collect information about teacher efficacy, principal leadership, school safety, students’ activities, and so forth. They enable school administrators to understand and address many issues on campus when used in conjunction with other student and staff data. However, these days each district develops the questionnaire according to its own needs and rarely provides supporting evidence for the reliability of items in the scale, that is, whether an individual item contributes significant information to the questionnaire. The Item Response Theory (IRT) is a useful tool that helps examine how much information each item and the whole scale can provide. Our study applied IRT to examine individual items in a school climate survey and assessed the efficiency of the survey after the removal of items that contributed little to the scale. The purpose of this study is to show how IRT can be applied to empirically validate school climate surveys.

Towards an integrative perspective on the structure of teacher work engagement,"Perera, Harsha N.; Vosicka, Lucie; Granziera, Helena; McIlveen, Peter","In recent years, there has been a bourgeoning scholarly interest in teacher engagement that has stemmed, in part, from broader policy discussions around teacher effectiveness. However, theory and research on the dimensional structure of teacher engagement data remains underdeveloped, potentially limiting the interpretational utility of inferences drawn from teacher engagement research. The present study examined the dimensionality of teacher work engagement data using an analytic framework designed to account for multiple sources of construct-relevant multidimensionality. In addition, the measurement and structural invariance across teaching level, the longitudinal invariance and stability, and criterion-related validity with respect to job satisfaction were examined. Results showed that a bifactor-ESEM model, characterized by factors representing general engagement and specific energetic investments, provided the best representation of teacher engagement data. This measurement structure was found to be invariant across teaching level; however, plausible latent mean differences in the engagement dimensions were found across primary and secondary teachers, such that primary teachers reported significantly higher general engagement and specific engagement with students than secondary teachers. Results also supported the full longitudinal measurement invariance of the retained measurement structure and considerable rank-order stability of the general and specific engagement dimensions over a four-month period. Finally, evidence of the criterion-related validity of the engagement scores with respect to job satisfaction was obtained. Taken together, the study yields crucial evidence supporting a novel multidimensional, hierarchical representation of teacher engagement.

The U.S. Department of Education outlined a three-domain conceptualization of school climate (i.e., safe and supportive schools model) that includes engagement, safety, and the school environment. To examine the applicability of this school climate model in Mexico, the present study tested its measurement invariance across middle school students in the United States (n = 15,099) and Mexico (n = 2,211). Findings supported full invariance for engagement and modified-safety scales indicating that factor loadings and intercepts contributed almost equally to factor means, and scale scores were comparable across groups. Partial invariance was found for the environment scales. Results of a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) consisting of all 13 school climate scales indicated significantly positive associations among all scales in the U.S. sample and among most scales in the Mexico sample. Implications of these findings are discussed.",2019,,Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment,37,1,55-68,,10.1177/0734282917731459,,#12572,Shukla 2019,,,Yes
Cross-National Measurement Invariance of the Teacher and Classmate Support Scale.,"Torsheim, Torbjørn; Samdal, Oddrun; Rasmussen, Mette; Freeman, John; Griebler, Robert; Dür, Wolfgang","The cross-national measurement invariance of the teacher and classmate support scale was assessed in a study of 23202 Grade 8 and 10 students from Austria, Canada, England, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, and Slovenia, participating in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) 2001/2002 study. A multi-group means and covariance analysis supported configural and metric invariance across countries, but not full scalar equivalence. The composite reliability was adequate and highly consistent across countries. In all seven countries, teacher support showed stronger associations with school satisfaction than did classmate support, with the results being highly consistent across countries. The results indicate that the teacher and classmate support scale may be used in cross-cultural studies that focus on relationships between teacher and classmate support and other constructs. However, the lack of scalar equivalence indicates that direct comparison of the levels support across countries might not be warranted.

Practices for Improving Secondary School Climate: A Systematic Review of the Research Literature,"Voight, Adam; Nation, Maury","School climate has received increased attention in education policy and, in response, educators are seeking strategies to improve the climates of their middle and high schools. However, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the empirical evidence for what works in school climate improvement. This article constitutes a systematic review of programs and practices with empirical support for improving school climate. It deﬁnes school climate and provides a methodology for identifying and evaluating relevant studies.

The review concludes with a critical appraisal of what we know about school climate improvement and what we still need to know.",2016,,American Journal of Community Psychology,58,2-Jan,174-191,,10.1002/ajcp.12074,,#12574,Voight 2016,,,No
Measuring school climate: Invariance across middle and high school students,"Waasdorp, Tracy Evian; Lindstrom Johnson, Sarah; Shukla, Kathan D.; Bradshaw, Catherine P.","Positive school climate has been consistently associated with many desirable student outcomes in both middle and high schools. However, there has been little work comparing the perceptions across these two school settings. The U.S. Department of Education conceptualized a three-factor model for school climate consisting of safety, engagement, and environment. Drawing on data from 29,720 middle and 34,950 high school students, the fit of the three-factor model was examined for measurement invariance, to explore whether the measure functioned similarly across both middle and high schools. The results indicated measurement invariance, which suggests that practitioners and researchers can confidently compare findings across middle and high schools to inform local decision making related to school-based programming. A series of multilevel analyses also explored the extent to which perceptions of school climate differed for middle and high school students; these results generally indicated that middle school students perceived the school more favorably than high school students. Implications of these findings for social workers are considered.

Preliminary investigation of the psychological sense of school membership scale with primary school students in a cross-cultural context.,"Wagle, Rhea; Dowdy, Erin; Yang, Chunyan; Palikara, Olympia; Castro, Susana; Nylund-Gibson, Karen; Furlong, Michael J.","The Psychological Sense of School Membership (PSSM) scale has been used for more than 20 years to measure students' sense of school belonging, yet its psychometric properties have had limited examination with pre-adolescent children. This study investigated the utility and psychometrics of the PSSM in three primary school samples from the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. Exploratory factor analysis revealed good fit for a unidimensional factor structure in the US sample, which was subsequently confirmed in all three samples. Partial invariance across all three samples and full invariance across pairwise samples (United States and United Kingdom; United Kingdom and China) was found.

Measuring social support and school belonging in Black/African American and White children,"Wegmann, Kate M.","Objective: To determine the suitability of the Elementary School Success Profile for Children (ESSP-C) for assessment and comparison of social support and school belonging between Black/African American and White students. Methods: Multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis and invariance testing were conducted to determine the ESSP-C’s validity for use with Black/African American and White students. Latent mean comparisons were performed to determine statistically significant differences in school belonging and social support between racial/ethnic groups. Results: The ESSP-C demonstrated partial measurement invariance at a level (93% invariant) that supports the validity of the measure for Black/African American and White students. Black/African American students reported a significantly higher mean level of school belonging compared to White students. Conclusion: The ESSP-C can be used to make valid assessments and comparisons of social support and school belonging between Black/African American and White students, which may be useful in guiding school social work practice and intervention.

Examining Measurement Invariance of a School Climate Survey Across Race and Ethnicity.,"Whitehouse, Anna; Zeng, Songtian; Troeger, Rebecca; Cook, Amy; Minami, Takuya","Positive school climate is a key determinant factor of students' psychological well-being, safety, and academic achievement. Although researchers have examined the validity of school climate measures, there is a dearth of research investigating differences in student perceptions of school climate across race and ethnicity. This study evaluated the factor stability of a widely used school climate survey using factor analyses and measurement invariance techniques across racial/ethnic groups. Results of a confirmatory factor analysis indicated a five-factor structure for a school climate survey, and weak measurement invariance was found across Hispanic, Black, and White student groups (ΔCFI =.008). According to paired t tests, significant differences were found among racial/ethnic respondent groups across two factors: teacher and school effectiveness and sense of belonging and care. Validated school climate measures that are culturally and racially responsive to students' experiences allow for accurate interpretations of school climate data.

Students' perceptions of school climate in the U.S. and China.,"Yang, Chunyan; Bear, George G.; Chen, Fang Fang; Zhang, Wei; Blank, Jessica C.; Huang, Xishan","Although the construct of student climate has been studied extensively in the United States, we know little about how school climate is perceived in other countries. With large class sizes yet higher academic achievement and less disruptive and aggressive student behaviors, schools in China present a contrast to many schools in the United States. Differences in school climate between the two countries were examined in this study. The sample consisted of 10,400 American and 3,435 Chinese students across three grade levels (elementary, middle, and high school) in 85 American and 22 Chinese schools. Factor structure and measurement invariance across countries were ﬁrst established for the Modiﬁed-Delaware School Climate Survey-Student. Differences in latent means were then tested. Across all three grade levels Chinese students scored signiﬁcantly higher than American students on all four subscales (Teacher–Student Relations, Student–Student Relations, School Liking, and Fairness of School Rules). Effects sizes tended to be smallest in elementary schools and largest in middle schools. Signiﬁcant differences between American and Chinese students exist in their perceptions of school climate. It is likely that those differences can be attributed to cultural differences in respect of authority, academic and social values, self-regulation and peer-regulation of behaviors, and teachers’ classroom management.",2013,,School Psychology Quarterly,28,1,24-Jul,,10.1037/spq0000002,,#12580,Yang 2013,,,No
Parental perceptions of school climate in the United States and China: Advancing cross-country understanding,"Yang, Chunyan; Chan, Meiki; Chen, Chun; Jimerson, Shane R.","To advance cross-country understanding of parental perceptions of school climate, this study examined the psychometric properties of the Delaware School Climate Survey–Home version (DSCS-H) and also compared the parental perception of school climate among Chinese (n = 999) and American (n = 1,251) parents. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the DSCS-H was best supported by a second-order factor model in both samples and full measurement invariance across countries was evident. Comparison of overall school climate latent means revealed that American parents from elementary schools perceived a more positive overall school climate than did Chinese parents. Conversely, Chinese parents of students in high school perceived a more positive overall school climate than the American parents. The latent-mean difference of parental perception of the overall school climate in middle schools across the United States and China was not significantly different. Finally, the latent mean differences in school climate subfactors varied across grade levels. Implications for using the DSCS-H for assessing and understanding the perception of school climate among parents from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds are discussed.

"School climate perceptions at the intersection of sex, grade, sexual, and gender identity.","Ioverno, Salvatore; Russell, Stephen T.","School climate is an important construct in research on adolescents. Yet, no known studies have evaluated whether the measured school climate constructs are equivalent across lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (LGBTQ), and heterosexual students as well as sex and grade levels. This study assessed measurement equivalence of a second‐order school climate construct across 1) sexual identity and sex among cisgender adolescents and 2) sexual and gender identity and grade level among cisgender and transgender adolescents. Data come from a California statewide survey of middle and high school students. Measurement equivalence was supported. This study reinforces prior findings on sexual and gender minority disparities and sheds light on an interesting pattern of school experiences across grades that deserves further investigation.

Assessing the Comparability of Teacher-Related Constructs in TIMSS 2015 across 46 Education Systems: An Alignment Optimization Approach,"Glassow, Leah Natasha; Rolfe, Victoria; Hansen, Kajsa Yang","Research related to the ""teacher characteristics"" dimension of teacher quality has proven inconclusive and weakly related to student success, and addressing the teaching contexts may be crucial for furthering this line of inquiry. International large-scale assessments are well positioned to undertake such questions due to their systematic sampling of students, schools, and education systems. However, researchers are frequently prohibited from answering such questions due to measurement invariance related issues. This study uses the traditional multiple group confirmatory factor analysis (MGCFA) and an alignment optimization method to examine measurement invariance in several constructs from the teacher questionnaires in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 2015 across 46 education systems. Constructs included mathematics teacher's ""Job satisfaction,"" ""School emphasis on academic success,"" ""School condition and resources,"" ""Safe and orderly school,"" and teacher's ""Self-efficacy."" The MGCFA results show that just three constructs achieve invariance at the metric level. However, an alignment optimization method is applied, and results show that all five constructs fall within the threshold of acceptable measurement non-invariance. This study therefore presents an argument that they can be validly compared across education systems, and a subsequent comparison of latent factor means compares differences across the groups. Future research may utilize the estimated factor means from the aligned models in order to further investigate the role of teacher characteristics and contexts in student outcomes.",2021,,"Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability",33,1,105-137,"Springer.

Measuring Perceptions of School Learning Environments for Younger Learners,"Gilman, Leon J.; Zhang, Bo; Jones, Curtis J.","Students' perceptions of the learning environment play an important role in their academic achievement and social lives. While most measures of school environment have been developed for middle- and high-school students, they also have been used for younger students, such as 4th and 5th graders. What is unclear is whether these measures are actually valid enough for younger student populations. We investigated whether the measurement invariance of one such measure, the popular 5Essentials of School Culture and Climate Survey, holds for younger learners and middle-school students. Results showed that not all measurement invariances hold across younger (4th and 5th grade) and older learners (7th grade). Moreover, half of the survey questions show differential item functioning (DIF). Findings from this study suggest that younger and older students could perceive school learning environments differently.

This study was the first to investigate the validity and utility of the adolescent covitality construct, which is conceptualized as the synergistic effect of positive mental health resulting from the interplay among multiple positive-psychological building blocks. Findings from confirmatory factor analyses, invariance analysis, and latent means testing all supported the theoretical model underlying the SEHS, indicating that the second-order covitality model was the best fit for both males and females. Results from a path-modeling analysis indicated that covitality was a strong predictor of students’ subjective well-being (operationalized as a composite of life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect), and findings from additional concurrent validity analyses indicated that adolescents’ covitality level was significantly associated with self-reported academic achievement, perceptions of school safety, substance use, and experiences of depressive symptoms.

"Multicultural Competence Scale for Prospective Teachers: Development, Validation and Measurement Invariance","Erdem, Devrim","Purpose: This study reports on the development, validation and measurement invariance of the Multicultural Competency Scale (MCS) for pre-service teachers. Research Methods: Data from 640 pre-service teachers were collected for two studies. After data screening procedures 628 responses were left. The data were divided into two sets for exploratory factor (n1=314) and confirmatory factor analysis (n2=314) using a random split half method in SPSS. Findings: According to the results of the exploratory factor analysis, a 14-item, three-factor solution came out: awareness, skill and knowledge. Awareness subscale aims to measure the teacher's awareness of his or her own cultural affiliation. Knowledge subscale attempts to measure the teacher's willingness to learn about diverse cultures. Skill subscale intends to measures the teacher's competence to organize and adapt the educational environment and materials according to the multicultural class. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the three-factor oblique model was a good fit to the data. The subscales of the MCS demonstrated adequate internal consistency. Measurement invariance tests revealed that full configural, metric, scalar invariance and partial strict invariance were achieved across gender. Implications for Research and Practice: Validity and reliability analysis of the scale suggest that the MCS-14 has satisfactory psychometric features. Thus, the MCS can be utilized to diagnose pre-service teachers' multicultural competency and to investigate changes in their strengths and weaknesses in multicultural competency during the training. The MCS enables pre-service teachers to self-assess and to recognize their position of multicultural competence. The MCS also allows researchers to predict teachers' future success in diverse classrooms.",2020,,Eurasian Journal of Educational Research,,87,28-Jan,"ANI Publishing Company.

The home mathematics environment of dual-language learning children and their early mathematics skills.,"Cosso, Jimena; Purpura, David J.; Maeda, Yukiko; Bofferding, Laura","The home mathematics environment (HME) can foster children's mathematics skills. Little is known about this association for children from culturally diverse backgrounds. Using Head Start FACES dataset we categorize children into three groups: English monolingual (n = 949); Spanish-speaking Dual Language Learners (DLLs) fluent in English (n = 346); and Spanish-speaking DLLs not-yet-fluent in English (n = 192), to examine whether the HME is related to children's early mathematics abilities above and beyond their vocabulary skills. Using multi-group analyses with a structural equation-modeling framework, we found that measurement invariance test supports the factorial equivalence of HME construct between groups. However, while HME positively and significantly predict children's mathematics skills for the English monolingual group, HME did not significantly predict mathematics skills among the Spanish-speaking DLL groups regardless of their English proficiency. We discuss our findings in relation to the need for additional HME items that are sensitive to diverse cultural contexts. • This article aims to understand the culturally diverse association of the home mathematics environment (HME) and children's mathematics outcomes. • We found that measurement invariance test supports the factorial equivalence of HME construct between Dual Language Learners and Monolingual groups. • HME positively and significantly predict children's mathematics skills for the English monolingual group. • HME did not significantly predict mathematics skills among the Latino DLL groups regardless of their English proficiency. • These findings shed light on the need for identifying cultural variance in the HME of Latino and English-monolingual families and its association with children's early mathematics performance.
